      "Abstract: Dietary supplements are products containing nutrients sold in various medicinal forms,\n",
      "and their widespread use may stem from the conviction that a preparation that looks like a drug\n",
      "must have therapeutic properties. The aim of this scoping review is to present what is known\n",
      "about the effects of using selected dietary supplements in the context of chronic diseases, as well\n",
      "as the risks associated with their use. The literature shows that the taking of vitamin and mineral\n",
      "supplements by healthy people neither lowers their risk of cardiovascular diseases nor prevents\n",
      "the development of malignancies. Many scientiﬁc societies recognize that omega-3 fatty acids\n",
      "lower blood triglycerides, but whether taking them prevents heart disease is less clear-cut. Taking\n",
      "weight loss supplements is not an effective method of ﬁghting obesity. Often, some supplements\n",
      "are increasingly sold illegally, which is then also associated with the higher risk that they may\n",
      "be adulterated with banned substances, thus making them even more dangerous and potentially\n",
      "life-threatening. Supplements are necessary in cases of nutrient deﬁciency; however, even though\n",
      "prescription is not required, their use should be recommended and monitored by a physician.\n",

      "1. Introduction\n",
      "In accordance with the European Union law, as well as the United States law, dietary\n",
      "supplements mean products that are concentrated sources of vitamins, minerals, or other\n",
      "substances with a nutritional or physiological effect (e.g., amino acids, essential fatty acids,\n",
      "probiotics, plants, and herbal extracts) intended to supplement the regular diet. Dietary\n",
      "supplements are produced in the form of capsules, tablets, pills, and other similar forms,\n",
      "designed to be taken in measured small unit quantities [1,2]. Dietary supplements, despite\n",
      "their route of administration and drug-like appearance, have been classiﬁed as foodstuffs\n",
      "and not medicines. Thus, in formal terms, supplement users are consumers rather than\n",
      "patients, but the question remains whether it is sick or healthy individuals who should\n",
      "be the primary users. The market for dietary supplements continues to expand at a rapid\n",
      "pace, and manufacturers develop products for health problems affecting almost all organs\n",
      "of the body, as well as for non-existing conditions, e.g., supplements for bladder elasticity.\n",
      "Additionally, a growing awareness among the public about the role of nutrition in the\n",
      "maintenance of health, together with widespread beliefs about today’s food being poor in\n",
      "vitamins (e.g., due to impoverished soil), are among the reasons for dietary supplement\n",

      "almost 40% had taken dietary supplements during the previous 30 days when they were\n",
      "questioned [3,4]. In Poland, supplement use has been reported by 30–78% of adolescents\n",

      "dietary supplements, both in Poland and worldwide, which are primarily vitamins and\n",
      "minerals, followed by omega-3 fatty acids [5,7,13,14]. In the case of dietary supplements\n",
      "for weight loss, the most used ingredients were considered, i.e., chromium, chitosan, green\n",
      "tea extract, bitter orange, and Garcinia cambogia [15,16].\n",

      "last decade, including randomized placebo-controlled trials, meta-analyses of such trials,\n",
      "and other original studies, as well as position statements by scientiﬁc societies. Due to the\n",

      "excluding studies on pregnant women.\n",

      "that a high intake of omega-3 fatty acids from ﬁsh and seafood lowers the risk of cardio-\n",
      "vascular disease incidence and mortality [17,18] and that disease incidence is inversely\n",
      "correlated with fruit and vegetable consumption [19,20].\n",

      "is as beneﬁcial as consuming marine omega-3 fatty acid foods and whether they may\n",
      "become an alternative product for people who do not consume ﬁsh.\n",

      "randomized trials from recent years should be cited ﬁrst. One of them is the British\n",
      "Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 8897\n",
      "3 of 24\n",
      "ASCEND study that was conducted with a cohort of 15,480 patients (age ≥40 years)\n",
      "with diabetes showing no evidence of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, who were\n",
      "administered either 840 mg of marine omega-3 fatty acids or a placebo for an average of\n",
      "7.4 years. This study showed no signiﬁcant difference in the primary endpoints (i.e., non-\n",
      "fatal myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or vascular death) or the\n",
      "secondary endpoints (ﬁrst serious vascular event or any arterial revascularization) between\n",
      "the study and control groups. The authors concluded that the results of their study did\n",
      "not show that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation prevents vascular events [22]. In an\n",
      "American trial, the VITAL study, conducted with a group of 25,871 healthy individuals\n",
      "aged ≥50 years, results revealed that consumption of 1 g of ﬁsh oil/day (840 mg EPA and\n",
      "DHA) for a median of 5.3 years did not lower the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or\n",

      "vascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) by 26%. The authors\n",
      "emphasized that the beneﬁts demonstrated in their study should not be transferred to all\n",
      "omega-3 preparations, especially dietary supplements, due to the differences between the\n",
      "composition of supplements compared with the preparation used in their study [24]. The\n",
      "literature also shows that 4 g of icosapent ethyl improves the lipid proﬁle in patients with\n",
      "statin intolerance [25]. Many other experts also emphasize that omega-3 fatty acids (of\n",
      "proven quality) may be particularly beneﬁcial for statin-intolerant patients with obesity,\n",
      "diabetes, or metabolic syndrome in whom elevated LDL cholesterol is accompanied by\n",
      "high levels of triglycerides [26].\n",
      "However, the STRENGTH randomized clinical trial of 2020 did not provide optimistic\n",
      "results. In that study, administration of 4 g of an omega-3 preparation with increased\n",
      "bioavailability (carboxylic acid formulation of EPA and DHA) to high cardiovascular risk\n",
      "patients treated with statins for more than 3 years proved of no beneﬁt in terms of major\n",
      "cardiovascular events, and this ﬁnding resulted in early termination of the study [27].\n",
      "As experts point out, such divergent results of single studies may result from different\n",
      "proportions of individual fatty acids in the preparations, the doses of the preparations,\n",
      "the length of the study, or the varying initial concentrations of omega-3 in the blood of\n",
      "the patients [28].\n",
      "To obtain clearer data in such situations, conclusions from meta-analyses of random-\n",
      "ized controlled trials are typically used, and though these have been quite numerous in\n",
      "the past 10 years, their results do not provide sufﬁcient evidence to form an unambiguous\n",
      "conclusion. The ﬁndings of three 2012 meta-analyses showed that omega-3 fatty acid\n",
      "supplementation did not lower the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, cerebrovascular\n",
      "events, cardiovascular mortality [29,30], or cardiovascular incidents in patients with exist-\n",
      "ing cardiovascular diseases [31]. A meta-analysis published one year later revealed that\n",
      "supplementation with omega-3 fatty acids reduced the risk of myocardial infarction by\n",
      "25% and the risk of cardiac death by 32% in patients with cardiovascular diseases [32],\n",
      "while a meta-analysis published in 2014 reported a 12% reduction in death from cardiac\n",
      "causes in patients with coronary heart disease who took omega-3 fatty acids [33]. In turn,\n",
      "a 2018 meta-analysis of randomized studies of omega-3 fatty acids taken, showed no\n",
      "effects on non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease events, or major vas-\n",
      "cular events [34], a ﬁnding that is consistent with another 2018 meta-analysis that also\n",
      "showed no relationship between omega-3 fatty acids consumption and lowered risk of\n",
      "cardiovascular disorders [35]. In contrast, the results of one of two 2019 meta-analyses of\n",
      "randomized clinical trials showed that taking omega-3 fatty acids reduced the risk of major\n",
      "Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 8897\n",
      "4 of 24\n",
      "vascular events by 5%, non-fatal myocardial infarction by 11%, and death by coronary\n",
      "heart disease by 9% [36]. The second 2019 meta-analysis of the studies, from which the\n",
      "REDUCE-IT study was excluded because of the comparatively high level of its omega-3\n",
      "dose, showed that omega-3 supplementation was associated with lower risk of myocardial\n",
      "infarction by 8%, total coronary heart disease by 5%, coronary heart disease death by 8%,\n",
      "and cardiovascular death by 7% [37]. Further evidence of the beneﬁcial effect of omega-3\n",
      "fatty acids in reducing cardiovascular risk is also found in the results of two meta-analyses\n",
      "from 2020 [38,39], although there was also an associated higher risk of bleeding events and\n",
      "atrial ﬁbrillation events in some instances [39].\n",
      "Against the background of the current state of scientiﬁc knowledge, what are the posi-\n",
      "tions of the scientiﬁc societies responsible for recommendations to the medical community?\n",
      "The International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) stated in 2017 that omega-3 fatty acids are\n",
      "proven to lower triglycerides (scientiﬁc evidence: class I, level A) [40,41] and added to this\n",
      "view in 2020 by indicating the need for EPA and DHA supplementation in heart failure,\n",
      "especially in patients after myocardial infarction [42]. According to the ILEP, omega-3 fatty\n",
      "acids in doses of 1–4 g daily reduce triglyceride levels by 18–25% [40]. The European Society\n",
      "of Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) both state that doses\n",
      "of 2–3 g reduce triglyceride levels by about 30% [43]. The European Society of Cardiology\n",
      "and other societies on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice, as of 2019, did\n",
      "not recommend omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for cardiovascular diseases prevention\n",
      "due to the lack of reliable proof of its beneﬁcial effects [20]. Meanwhile, the 2019 American\n",
      "College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline on the primary prevention\n",
      "of cardiovascular disease makes no mention of omega-3 fatty acids [44], which should\n",
      "be understood as a lack of support for their use. The American Heart Association stated\n",
      "in 2017 that supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids would be beneﬁcial in patients with\n",
      "coronary heart disease (CHD), including those after heart attack, as it may lower the risk of\n",
      "CHD-related mortality by 10% [45].\n",
      "In conclusion, research ﬁndings on the impact of omega-3 fatty acid supplementa-\n",
      "tion on the risks or beneﬁts in relation to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases vary\n",
      "signiﬁcantly. However, there are many indications that taking omega-3 fatty acid prepa-\n",
      "rations by healthy people do not have such beneﬁcial effects as eating the same fats in\n",
      "ﬁsh. Therefore, consumption of omega-3 capsules does not offer an easy way to improve\n",
      "nutrition and, apparently, cannot serve as a substitute for ﬁsh and seafoods in the diet.\n",
      "Importantly, recent years have brought a growing number of reports about low-quality\n",
      "ﬁsh oil supplements [46], which according to various authors are nowhere near as good as\n",
      "preparations registered as medicines [47]. In New Zealand, as many as 83% of supplements\n",
      "containing ﬁsh oils were shown to exceed permissible levels of peroxides, which are an\n",
      "indicator of fat deterioration [48]; similarly, in the US, oxidized fatty acids, cholesterol, and\n",
      "toxins were found in many omega-3 supplements [49]. In Poland, there is a wide range\n",
      "of supplement products on the market containing omega-3 fatty acids and, as is the case\n",
      "throughout the European Union, there is no legal requirement for standardization of such\n",

      "5 of 24\n",
      "The authors of the 2018 meta-analysis of randomized studies concluded that vitamin–\n",

      "Additionally, a randomized study in the US with more than 14,000 physicians reported\n",

      "and Galan et al., no signiﬁcant effect on the risk of major cardiovascular events was\n",

      "Weight loss supplements are usually multi-ingredient preparations, with over 4000 in-\n",
      "dividual substances used in the production process. The average weight loss supplement\n",

      "state that producers are responsible for the safety of a product [124,126]. Some authors have\n",
      "stated that they believe that supplements are released onto the market to be tested by the\n",
      "end-users [127]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may withdraw a product from\n",
      "the market only after it has been deemed unsafe [128,129]. Additionally, routine quality con-\n",
      "trols are not carried out to check the active substance content and label compliance [105,107],\n",
      "and yet half of some studies’ respondents claim that dietary supplements are sufficiently\n",
      "monitored, in the same way that over-the-counter drugs are [107,130].\n",
      "Evidence of the unfavorable effects of supplement use continues to accumulate. Ac-\n",
      "cording to the National Estimates of Emergency Department Visits, the most frequent\n",
      "complaints in the US concern herbal or complementary nutritional preparations, including\n",
      "weight loss products (66% and 26% of all interventions, respectively) [131]. As far as weight\n",
      "loss products are concerned, 13,000 complaints are registered annually, including 2000 hos-\n",
      "pitalizations [132]. The main side effects include cardiac symptoms (palpitations and\n",
      "chest pains), and the same symptoms have been observed in relation to the use of muscle\n",
      "building and sexual potency supplements [131]. The literature emphasizes that long-term\n",
      "effects of supplement use are difﬁcult to predict and will only be known after they have\n",
      "been present on the market for some years [133]. The Ephedra sinica shrub is an interesting\n",
      "example of this issue, as it became a component of weight loss preparations in the early\n",
      "1990s in the US and was withdrawn in 2004 due to the incidence of life-threatening cardiac\n",
      "side effects [112]. However, the use of the Ephedra sinica plant in foods, and consequently\n",
      "in dietary supplements, was not banned in the European Union until 2015 [134]. Ephedra\n",
      "herbal supplements accounted for over half of the complaints about adverse reactions to\n",
      "herbs lodged with the US National Estimates of Emergency Department Visits, yet these\n",
      "products constituted only 1% of total herbal product sales in the US at the time [112]. In\n",
      "2004, the FDA received over 18,000 complaints and ﬁnally ruled that the product should\n",
      "be withdrawn [114]. Sibutramine (active ingredient in medicines) is yet another example\n",
      "of a substance used is weight loss preparations whose negative side effects were revealed\n",
      "only after people had been using it for some time. It was released on the market in the late\n",
      "1990s as a component of an appetite-blocking drug but was withdrawn in 2010 due to a\n",
      "signiﬁcant risk of cardiovascular disorders [135].\n",
      "Since being ofﬁcial banned, both sibutramine and Ephedra sinica have become popular,\n",
      "illegal components of weight loss supplements. In China, signiﬁcant quantities of sibu-\n",
      "tramine were detected in 27 out of 120 weight loss supplements [103]. Despite a number of\n",
      "components being listed on the label of one Chinese product, Meizitanc, when investigated\n",
      "in Poland, sibutramine was the only substance in this weight loss [136]. There is also an\n",
      "associated problem of additional ingredients that are also dangerous being included with\n",
      "the banned substances. For instance, the number of reports on laxatives, antidepressant,\n",
      "yohimbine, and even amphetamine and its derivatives being found in supplements con-\n",
      "tinues to grow [105,106,127,137]. A US study revealed that 11 out of 21 supplements that\n",
      "contained the Acacia rigidula extract that were purchased on the Internet contained the iso-\n",
      "mer of amphetamine [138]. In South Korea, substances that bore a structural resemblance\n",
      "to amphetamine were found in 10 out of 110 weight loss supplements [139]. In Italy, 28%\n",
      "of the supplements purchased online contained sibutramine or substances only permitted\n",
      "in medicines or their analogs, which had not been tested for toxicology [135]. Apart from\n",
      "weight loss supplements, preparations for muscle building and sexual potency have also\n",
      "been found to be contaminated. International studies indicate that 12–58% of the supple-\n",
      "ments for physically active people contained substances that have previously been banned\n",
      "by the World Anti-Doping Agency [140].\n",
      "Despite legal requirements, labels of dietary supplements cannot be treated as a source\n",
      "of reliable information about the products’ contents. In North America, where the brain\n",
      "health supplement market is developing rapidly, 10 out of 12 products contained non-\n",
      "Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 8897\n",
      "16 of 24\n",
      "declarable components, and 8 did not contain at least 1 of the ingredients listed on the\n",
      "label [141]. Overall, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the supplements contain at\n",
      "least one banned substance. Importantly, in view of the number of products available on\n",
      "the market, the published cases are merely the tip of the iceberg [105,106].\n",
      "Lack of reliable data on supplement safety, contamination, and adulteration are the\n",
      "reasons why supplements may cause grave side effects. So far, most reports have focused\n",
      "on the green tea extract, which may have caused liver damage, including fatal damage, in\n",
      "more than 50 individuals. For example, Exolise—a weight loss supplement that contained\n",
      "green tea extract—was withdrawn from the market in Spain and France in 2003 [112,129].\n",
      "Dexaprine was a multi-ingredient supplement with green tea extract that was withdrawn in\n",
      "2014 in Holland, as even half a tablet resulted in emesis, anxiety, and tachycardia [106]. In\n",
      "Poland, anaphylactic reactions were observed in the case of a multi-ingredient preparation\n",
      "with green tea extract known as Linea Detox [133]. Supplements that contain Garcinia\n",
      "cambogia may also pose a threat to patient life. Two cases are Hydroxycut, which resulted\n",
      "in liver damage, heart arrhythmia, and death [118,124,132]; and Thermatrim, which was\n",
      "suspected of causing toxic leukoencephalopathy [142]. Kratom is yet another example of a\n",
      "dangerous dietary supplement for muscle building that was withdrawn in 2018 from the\n",
      "US market after it caused the death of a young man [128].\n",
      "The rapid increase in the availability of dietary supplements aimed at improving\n",
      "cognitive function, including Alzheimer’s disease, is the reason for the FDA issuing an\n",
      "ofﬁcial statement in 2019 to inform the public that the agency did not investigate dietary\n",
      "supplements for safety and effectiveness and that these preparations may be dangerous,\n",
      "ineffective, and delay patients’ decisions to seek medical help [143]. In light of the fact that\n",
      "the disturbing reports we have identiﬁed above continue to surface, there is an urgent need\n",
      "for a radical change in the way supplements are introduced to the market [127,144,145],\n",
      "especially in changing perceptions of products from “safe until proven unsafe” to “unsafe\n",
      "until proven safe” [128]. There is a consensus among the experts that supplements require\n",
      "controlled tests to be performed by independent laboratories to check for active substance\n",
      "content and possible adulteration [105–107].\n",
      "4. Discussion\n",
      "Due to persistent media messaging about poor eating habits and that the typical\n",
      "“Western diet” is far from nutritional, many people are convinced that their daily diet\n",
      "does not meet the recommended levels for vitamins and minerals. However, the scientiﬁc\n",
      "literature shows that taking vitamins and minerals without medical justiﬁcation does not\n",
      "lower the risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer and that sometimes it can even have a\n",
      "negative effect. It should also be borne in mind that disease is inﬂuenced by many factors,\n",
      "both genetic and environmental, and a beneﬁcial change in one element of the diet may not\n",
      "have any overall effect. Popular positive expectations of supplements are also dampened\n",
      "by the fact that they are more often used by people who already eat better, lead a healthier\n",
      "lifestyle, are better educated, and have a greater health awareness [6,8,10]. Therefore,\n",
      "in such cases where the person already has a better nutritional status, including a lack\n",
      "of vitamin and mineral deﬁciencies, supplementation may not be of beneﬁt, and long-\n",
      "term consumption of excessive quantities of these nutrients may, in fact, have detrimental\n",
      "side effects. The risk of such side effects increases when consumers take several dietary\n",
      "supplements at the same time (for example, “for immunity”, “for the heart”, or “for an\n",
      "efﬁcient mind”), as they may contain the same vitamins and minerals as each other.\n",
      "On the other hand, the beneﬁcial effect of using certain nutrients (omega-3 fatty\n",
      "acids) in the treatment of lipid disorders, as demonstrated in studies, undermines the\n",
      "registration of preparations intended for this purpose as dietary supplements. Dietary\n",
      "supplements, by their deﬁnition, serve to supplement the usual diet with nutrients or\n",
      "components with a physiological effect, and this group of preparations does not include\n",
      "medicinal products [1,2,146]. Due to one of the basic rules that the use of preparations\n",
      "for therapeutic purposes should be prescribed and under the supervision of a physician,\n",
      "Int. J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 8897\n",
      "17 of 24\n",
      "“therapeutic” doses of nutrients should not be used in food preparations. Moreover, Polish\n",
      "pharmaceutical law clearly emphasizes that in the case of a product that meets the criteria\n",
      "for classiﬁcation both as a medicinal product and as a dietary supplement, the provisions of\n",
      "pharmaceutical legislation, rather than food regulations, should be applied [147]. Currently,\n",
      "the dose of active ingredients is an important criterion in the registration process of dietary\n",
      "supplements [148]. It is also worth remembering that labeling and advertising of dietary\n",
      "supplements can neither imply nor make claims about the product’s preventive and/or\n",
      "therapeutic properties, which is consistent with food law and the regulations governing\n",
      "all foodstuffs [149]. Therefore, dietary supplement packaging may not contain informa-\n",
      "tion such as “for cancer prevention” or “for reducing cholesterol”. However, although\n",
      "such requirements have long been in food legislation, the practice of portraying dietary\n",
      "supplements as products that quickly alleviate the symptoms of numerous health con-\n",
      "ditions, both by labelling and advertising methods, is relatively common [143,150–152].\n",
      "Unsurprisingly, the public often ﬁnds it difﬁcult to differentiate between supplements and\n",
      "drugs [5,12] and uses the former to treat various medical conditions [128,153,154]. Such\n",
      "practices have been observed even in the US, where manufacturers are legally obligated to\n",
      "include the information “This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any\n",
      "disease” [9,128] on labels, unlike in the European Union. According to various authors,\n",
      "knowledge about supplements among some physicians and pharmacists also leaves much\n",
      "to be desired [155,156]. It is worth mentioning here that in Poland, considering the popular\n",
      "misconception that dietary supplements are drugs, as of 1 January 2020, self-regulation of\n",
      "TV broadcasting companies and supplement manufacturers [157] was introduced. The new\n",
      "regulations have introduced several important changes for TV advertising, chief among\n",
      "them the rule that every advertisement is required to include the following statement on\n",
      "screen: “Dietary supplement; contains ingredients which support physiological functions of the\n",
      "body by supplementing a typical diet; has no medicinal properties.”\n",
      "Considering the impact of dietary supplements on people’s health, it is important to\n",
      "remember that the results of short-term studies do not provide irrefutable data on their\n",
      "effectiveness and that even long-term studies, where lifestyle factors change over time and\n",
      "inﬂuence a person’s health, also pose a problem. When interpreting the results of research\n",
      "on intake of vitamin and mineral preparations, especially multivitamin–mineral supple-\n",
      "ments, it should also be remembered that there is a considerable degree of heterogeneity in\n",
      "supplement ingredients and amounts of nutrients because the composition of supplements\n",
      "is not directly regulated by law. Therefore, individual preparations may signiﬁcantly differ\n",
      "from each other in dose and composition of ingredients, thus affecting research results.\n",
      "In addition, it should be noted that administering vitamin and mineral supplements to\n",
      "the study group does not mean that the control group did not gain appropriate levels of\n",
      "these ingredients from their daily diets, and thus does not mean that the control group\n",
      "was at risk of hypovitaminosis. Therefore, identifying the potential beneﬁts of supplying\n",
      "nutrients in addition to the body’s normal requirements is difﬁcult.\n",
      "The author of this paper is aware of the limitations and issues in the cited studies and\n",
      "consequently is aware that this is not a systematic review. Therefore, it cannot be ruled\n",
      "out that some publications, possibly presenting different research results, may have been\n",
      "omitted. However, the author has made every effort to include as many publications as\n",
      "possible, including randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, and to discuss the\n",
      "individual issues in the paper in a balanced way, bearing in mind the length of the paper.\n",
      "Because of the widely different categories of dietary supplements, the article does not\n",
      "address the health effects of all, e.g., probiotics or polyphenols; thus, the author does not\n",
      "present an exhaustive discussion of the health effects resulting from taking supplements.\n",
      "5. Conclusions\n",
      "In the absence of clinical trials conducted by the manufacturers of dietary supplements\n",

      "an online questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 250 fitness supplement-consuming\n",
      "respondents. SEM analysis revealed significant associations between behavioral intentions and\n",
      "attitudes, perceived behavioral control, health motivation, and controlled precursors. However, it\n",

      "Supplementary drinks or fitness supplements are commonly used to enhance an\n",

      "and non-competitive athletes [1]. One widely known supplement for athletes and fitness\n",
      "enthusiasts is protein supplements like protein shakes. Others may be whey protein,\n",
      "caffeine, and creatine, to name a few. These supplements play a crucial role in helping\n",
      "individuals increase muscle mass, recover faster, and enhance their overall performance [2].\n",
      "Whey protein stands out as a top-quality protein source, containing more essential amino\n",
      "acids than traditional protein sources. Its numerous benefits have made it a popular choice\n",
      "for snacks and drinks among consumers [3]. Another widely embraced supplement is\n",
      "caffeine, which is found in many sports and food supplements. Caffeine reduces perceived\n",
      "effort, minimizes fatigue and pain, and proves to be effective for endurance and high-\n",
      "intensity activities, which is the choice of consumers [4].\n",
      "Creatine monohydrate is another well-known supplement used to gain muscle mass\n",
      "and support performance and recovery. It is known not to increase fat mass and remains\n",

      "and sports industry, evidence suggests that creatine can benefit not only athletes but also\n",
      "the elderly and the general population [6]. Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) also offer\n",
      "a plethora of benefits for consumers. As explained by Sanz et al. [7], BCAAs are stored\n",
      "directly in muscles and serve as the raw materials needed to build new muscle. This\n",
      "contributes to the overall process of strengthening muscles and alleviating post-workout\n",
      "soreness. Consumers often integrate these supplements into their routines with the aim of\n",
      "optimizing the outcomes they wish to achieve and support overall well-being [1].\n",
      "The sports supplement industry makes for an impressive market share of nearly\n",
      "$12 billion in the health/wellness portfolio and is projected to be worth $24.4 billion\n",
      "by 2025. In a study by Burke [4], which investigated 20 published studies about the\n",
      "prevalence, methods, and reasons for supplement consumption, it is evident from the\n",
      "findings that supplement consumption is prevalent among athletes and even more so in\n",
      "individuals competing at higher levels. It can also be confirmed that most gym-goers\n",
      "generally use dietary supplements, with a prevalence exceeding 40%, with a prevalence of\n",
      "44% in Portugal and 81% in South Africa [8]. In a set of different studies, the prevalence\n",
      "among gym-goers ranged from 29.4% to 47.5%, and these findings remained consistent. It\n",
      "was also seen that among 55 Spanish basketball players and English elite track and field\n",
      "athletes, the prevalence was 58% and 86%, respectively [9].\n",
      "When investigating the dietary habits of combat sports athletes in the Philippines,\n",
      "the findings indicated that the overall knowledge of the respondents on nutrition and\n",
      "dietary habits was exceptional. However, the understanding of individuals about the\n",
      "excess intake of vitamin and mineral supplements was poor [10]. Similarly, Elsahoryi\n",
      "et al. [11] assessed the trends on dietary supplements among students and found that\n",
      "supplements were deemed essential; however, their knowledge of them was concluded to\n",
      "be insufficient. The findings of these studies implicated a need for educational intervention\n",
      "on supplements. Furthermore, the presence of unlicensed and unsafe supplements poses\n",
      "a threat to uneducated consumers. The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\n",
      "issued a strong public caution regarding the use of 11 dietary supplements in 2019. This\n",
      "was because the products have not undergone the regular evaluation process of the agency,\n",
      "making it impossible to ensure the safety and quality of the items [12]. Additionally, the\n",
      "availability of dietary supplements that claimed to help in weight loss has increased in\n",
      "drugstores and supermarkets. Many of these supplements contain various ingredients,\n",
      "typically herbs, vitamins, and minerals, caffeine, and laxatives, that when taken collectively,\n",
      "have unclear effects [13].\n",
      "Individuals leading luxurious lifestyles tend to exhibit a higher inclination toward\n",
      "the use of supplements [14], indicating a correlation between lifestyle and the tendency\n",
      "to use supplements. Nagar [15] found attitude to be the most influencing predictor of\n",
      "consumers’ consumption intention of gym supplements, implying that customers’ attitudes\n",
      "can be affected by risk and benefits, social influence, and health consciousness. On the\n",
      "other hand, Campbell et al. [16] highlighted perceived behavioral control as not highly\n",
      "influenced by attitude and social norms. In another study, additional information on\n",
      "labels was found to significantly impact consumers’ behavioral intention to use dietary\n",
      "supplements [17]. The study further explained that consumers often consider using the\n",
      "supplement if its risks and benefits are well communicated on the label. It was also reported\n",
      "that customer consumption behavior with regard to fitness supplements is affected by\n",
      "their comprehension of the side effects [18]. Moreover, it was indicated that knowledge\n",
      "is a significant variable in consumers’ attitudes, beliefs, and intentions toward the use of\n",
      "supplements [19]. As knowledge grows, parallel improvement in understanding, belief,\n",
      "and intention to use supplements is present.\n",
      "Jairoun et al. [20] suggested a positive perception regarding the use of fitness sup-\n",
      "plements. That is, the consumption of fitness supplements has been perceived to lead to\n",
      "doping, and users demonstrate stronger intentions and attitudes toward it [21]. These\n",
      "studies highlighted the gap in proper education regarding supplements that can distort\n",
      "individuals’ ability to make informed and responsible choices about their consumption,\n",

      "potentially putting their health at risk [22,23]. Moreover, health behavior among consumers\n",
      "was barely addressed among the studies. It could be posited that scarce to no studies have\n",
      "been conducted regarding fitness supplement consumption, especially in the Philippines,\n",
      "where gym-goers and fitness enthusiasts are abundant [24]. The emphasis Filipinos place\n",
      "on both wellness and aesthetics has fueled a rise in gym participation nationwide. Conse-\n",
      "quently, there has been a notable uptrend in the demand for nutraceuticals, such as protein\n",
      "bars and powders, despite their higher costs [25].\n",
      "This study aimed to examine factors affecting the actual consumption of fitness supple-\n",
      "ments among health and fitness enthusiasts. This study employed a theoretical framework\n",
      "that combined the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Health Belief Model (HBM), and\n",
      "the recently developed Theoretical Framework of Motivation to Pursue Exercise Activities\n",
      "(TEMPA). By integrating these frameworks, this study provided a more holistic under-\n",
      "standing of the psychological and motivational factors that contribute to the consumption\n",
      "behavior and intention of fitness supplements. The significance of this study lies in its\n",
      "potential to contribute insights to both academia and the health and fitness industry. Un-\n",
      "derstanding the determinants of supplement consumption can aid in developing targeted\n",
      "interventions, educational programs, and marketing strategies to promote the responsible\n",
      "and informed use of fitness supplements among enthusiasts, as well as enhancing overall\n",
      "health and well-being. Furthermore, the incorporation of the framework represents a novel\n",
      "approach to studying health-related behavior, offering a more nuanced perspective on the\n",
      "intricate interplay of psychological, belief-based, and motivational factors in the context\n",
      "of fitness supplement consumption, which could be applied and extended among other\n",
      "related studies.\n",
      "2. Conceptual Analysis and Hypotheses Build-Up\n",
      "Figure 1 presents the conceptual framework of this study, integrating TPB, HBM, and\n",
      "TEMPA. A total of 12 hypotheses were generated along with 12 latent variables. Among the\n",
      "theories, the TPB is said to be a frequently used behavioral model that aids in investigating\n",
      "shifts in people’s behavior. This model operates on the premise that behavior is intentional,\n",
      "enabling the prediction of actions [26]. On the other hand, the HBM is a well-researched\n",
      "framework for understanding health behavior. It seeks to anticipate behavior related to\n",
      "health by examining specific patterns of beliefs [27]. Lastly, several studies have employed\n",
      "TEMPA to align with individuals’ physical efforts. TEMPA is a comprehensive model\n",
      "assessing individuals’ tendency to engage in physical activities, incorporating factors that\n",
      "may promote their intentions [28].\n",
      "Dealing with TPB domains, several studies have justified the effects of behavioral\n",
      "intention on up-taking dietary supplements. In this study, attitude refers to a disposition to\n",
      "react positively or negatively to a behavior [29]. It is evident in multiple studies that attitude\n",
      "is a variable that has a significant impact on consumer’s behavioral intention. In context,\n",
      "Conner et al. [30] investigated the environmental influences that contributed to the decision\n",
      "of women to use dietary supplements. The results showed that stronger intentions to use\n",
      "supplements were associated with positive attitudes. Liu et al. [31] assessed the effect of the\n",
      "fear of COVID-19 on purchase behavior on dietary supplements. Their findings supported\n",
      "that attitude, which, alongside other behavioral parameters, significantly affected purchase\n",
      "intention. Moreover, Nagar [15] examined the choice of gym supplements that gym-goers\n",
      "would purchase. The findings revealed that gym-goers’ intention to buy supplements is\n",
      "influenced by their attitude, which is shaped by perceived risk and benefit, social influence,\n",
      "and health consciousness.\n",
      "On the other hand, subjective norms represent an individual’s perception of others’\n",
      "opinions regarding the execution of a particular behavior, affecting the intentions of Iranian\n",
      "adolescent girls to intake iron and vitamin D supplements [32]. While Housman [33]\n",
      "analyzed the usage of sports-related supplements of elite female athletes, it was noted that\n",
      "their perceptions were influenced greatly by the beliefs held by significant people around\n",
      "them. Participants expressed that the strongest influences on their behavior came from\n",
      "\n",
      "Foods 2024, 13, 1424\n",
      "4 of 21\n",
      "parents and teammates. The findings of Haubenstricker [34] also stated that subjective\n",
      "norms and attitude were the most influential drivers in female bodybuilders’ intentions to\n",
      "use dietary supplements.\n",
      " \n",
      "Figure 1. Conceptual framework combining TEMPA, HBM, and TPB to assess behavioral intention\n",
      "and actual consumption of fitness supplements.\n",
      "In addition, Lino et al. [35] conducted a study to investigate the attitudes and beliefs\n",
      "on dietary supplements among HIV-positive black women. The findings of the study\n",
      "indicated that perceived behavioral control is a significant predictor of intention to use\n",
      "dietary supplements. Similarly, Chen et al. [36] examined the effects of the perceived\n",
      "benefits of vitamin D supplementation intention. The results presented that the levels of\n",
      "intention to take vitamin D supplements were accurately predicted by factors under the\n",
      "TPB domains; the highest was perceived behavioral control. Pawlak et al. [37] investigated\n",
      "the drivers of multivitamin consumption in female Caucasian college students. Perceived\n",
      "behavioral control, along with attitude, were found to have a significant impact on their\n",
      "behavioral intentions. Thus, in this study hypothesized the following:\n",
      "H1. Attitude has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\n",
      "H2. Subjective norms have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\n",
      "H3. Perceived behavioral control has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\n",
      "For health and consumers’ belief, Hanna and Hughes [38] investigated the perspective\n",
      "of the public regarding decision-making regarding over-the-counter drugs and their stance\n",
      "on the evidence supporting its effectiveness. The results of the study showed that the\n",
      "perceived effectiveness of the medicine influenced their intention to purchase. Similarly,\n",
      "Münstedt et al. [39] investigated the perceived effectiveness of complementary and alterna-\n",
      "tive medicine. The findings indicated that belief in the effectiveness of complementary and\n",
      "alternative medicine were motivating factors. Increasing perceived effectiveness results in\n",
      "\n",
      "Foods 2024, 13, 1424\n",
      "5 of 21\n",
      "a positive attitude and stronger purchase intention, underscoring the importance of the\n",
      "factor in consumer behavior [40]. Hence, the following was hypothesized:\n",
      "H4. Perceived effectiveness has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\n",
      "Motivation for health involves an individual’s readiness to modify their behavior\n",
      "for the sake of enhancing their well-being [41]. In the study by Ataei et al. [42], it was\n",
      "explained that a significant influence of health motivation, among other factors, on farmers’\n",
      "intentions to adopt green and safer pesticides was seen after they were aware of the benefits\n",
      "of utilizing it. This signified that attitude toward health and the prevention of diseases is\n",
      "one of the main drivers to utilize the greener alternatives. Moreover, Sirico [43] observed\n",
      "that Italian students often consumed food supplements with a focus on overall well-being.\n",
      "They underscored that the respondents’ pursuit of maintaining good health is a priority.\n",
      "Likewise, Kovács [44] found that leisure-time athletes primarily took supplements as a\n",
      "proactive measure to maintain their health. These findings collectively highlighted the\n",
      "trend of individuals engaging in behaviors aimed at improving their health. Therefore, the\n",
      "following could be hypothesized:\n",
      "H5. Health motivation has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\n",
      "Yazdanpanah et al. [45] found that the key factor influencing the intention to consume\n",
      "organic food among Iranian young adults is the perceived health benefit. This suggests\n",
      "that individuals are inclined to choose organic foods due to their perceived health benefits\n",
      "for both themselves and the environment, thereby increasing the likelihood of choosing\n",
      "organic options. In a similar vein, Saghafi-Asi [46] identified perceived benefits as a robust\n",
      "predictor of weight management behavior, and Shitu [47] reported a positive correlation\n",
      "between perceived benefits and preventive behavior against COVID-19. Thus, this study\n",
      "hypothesized the following:\n",
      "H6. Perceived benefit has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\n",
      "Perceived barriers, on the other hand, are the beliefs that carrying out a behavior is\n",
      "restricted due to psychosocial, physical, or financial factors. When assessing the predictors\n",
      "of the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, low perceived barriers were an important\n",
      "predictor of a definite intention to take the vaccine [48]. Bhandari [49] found that perceived\n",
      "barriers negatively affected the safety behaviors of farmers to use safer pesticides and\n",
      "adhere to safety behaviors; the findings indicated that educational programs and training\n",
      "were advised to mitigate the effect of these perceived barriers. Similarly, Pinho et al. [50]\n",
      "found that perceived barriers also had a significant effect on healthy eating. This suggests\n",
      "that individuals’ decision to carry out behaviors that positively affect health are significantly\n",
      "affected by perceived barriers. To which, this study hypothesized the following:\n",
      "H7. Perceived barriers have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\n",
      "Self-efficacy is one’s belief in being able to succeed in any task that they are given.\n",
      "This trait can be general or specific, allowing individuals to have a range of self-efficacy\n",
      "about themselves [51]. Upon investigating the relationship between dietary supplements\n",
      "and the general self-efficacy levels of athletes, the findings showed that athletes with\n",
      "lower self-efficacy tend to consume more supplements [52]. Broelz et al. [53] found that\n",
      "giving athletes a supplement with high salience caused them to work harder than products\n",
      "with low salience, underscoring the psychological benefit of supplements. Another study\n",
      "focused on ergogenic supplements’ effects on the performance of cycling athletes; they\n",
      "had a positive effect on the speed and endurance of the cyclists [54]. Similarly, López-\n",
      "Torres et al. [55] discovered that the consumption of ergogenic supplements aided in\n",
      "the performance of female athletes and enhanced their efficacy to reach specific physical\n",
      "\n",
      "Foods 2024, 13, 1424\n",
      "6 of 21\n",
      "needs and goals. In addition, Gacek [56] investigated the determinants of nutritional\n",
      "choices of Polish handball players; it was found that self-efficacy and the consumption of\n",
      "vegetables are positively correlated, thus indicating their belief in achieving specific goals.\n",
      "Encompassing those associated with both health and sports, it underscores the importance\n",
      "of a rational nutritional model. Thus, the following was hypothesized:\n",
      "H8. Self-efficacy significantly affects automatic precursors.\n",
      "H9. Self-efficacy significantly affects controlled precursors.\n",
      "For the precursors, TEMPA explains why individuals aspiring to engage in physical\n",
      "activity may not do so [57]. The framework considers both the automatic reactions triggered\n",
      "by physical activity cues and the inherent desire to avoid exerting too much physical\n",
      "effort. This explains that a person’s movements are swayed by automatic and controlled\n",
      "precursors. These precursors are triggered by the cues related to the movement, and how\n",
      "individuals feel about these cues was also said to affect the perceived effort that is needed\n",
      "to perform the movement [58]. For these precursors to be effective and drive an individual\n",
      "to engage in physical activity, the precursors supporting the intention should outweigh\n",
      "the negative precursors that reduce effort [28]. Ong et al. [24] exhibited that health and\n",
      "well-being are preceded by a person’s self-efficacy and its increase, which also increases\n",
      "their behavioral intention. Thus, the following was theorized:\n",
      "H10. Automatic precursors have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\n",
      "H11. Controlled precursors have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\n",
      "Goulet et al. [59] investigated the predictors of the use of performance-enhancing\n",
      "drugs (PED) among young athletes. To which, their study presented that all behavioral\n",
      "factors had a positive influence on behavioral intention. The results of the study suggested\n",
      "that psychosocial factors had a significant effect on their use of PEDs. In another study,\n",
      "Samoggia and Rezzaghi [60] investigated the effect of the consumption of products that\n",
      "contain caffeine on sports performance. Behavioral intention was the dependent variable\n",
      "in the study, presenting a positive outcome from the consumption of the products. Fur-\n",
      "thermore, in a study investigating the role of education on the use of energy supplements,\n",
      "Mehri et al. [61] found that behavioral intention had the most significant impact. Educa-\n",
      "tional interventions lowered the behavioral intention of the participants, which ultimately\n",
      "decreased the intake of the supplements. Relating to the positive results of studies, the\n",

      "the athletic population. Additional factors, e.g., related to performance or training adaptation, may be\n",
      "present among athletes. Therefore, it is not surprising to ﬁnd a higher prevalence of supplement use\n",

      "2.3. Questionnaire\n",
      "The quantitative questionnaire was divided into three sections on a single double-sided A4 sheet\n",
      "of paper. In the ﬁrst section, categorical variables were screened, including gender, age group, training\n",
      "frequency per week (Table 1), and main training goals (i.e., support health, weight loss, body shaping,\n",
      "bodybuilding, improve strength, improve endurance, improve sport speciﬁc performance, other\n",
      "reasons). In the second section, the supplement use was screened by listing 25 predeﬁned substances\n",
      "and product classes (Table 2). Spare lines were available to list “further” products not included in the\n",

      "4. Discussion\n",
      "4.1. Supplement Intake\n",
      "The aim of this study was to gain insight into the prevalence of supplement intake and used\n",
      "information sources among recreational ﬁtness center users in Switzerland. Overall, 82% of the ﬁtness\n",
      "center users consumed supplements. This prevalence is higher compared to a general population\n",
      "sample in Switzerland, where only 26% used supplements [6]. It is also higher in comparison with\n",
      "ﬁtness athlete populations from other countries and cultural regions [4,18–20], and even compared\n",
      "to reports from some elite athlete populations [4,16]. The deﬁnition of supplements and supplement\n",
      "use diﬀers across studies, i.e., intake prevalence depends on whether or not subjects are asked about\n",
      "their current intake, which is often deﬁned as the last four weeks as in the present study [4,16].\n",
      "When subjects are asked for longer timeframes, the prevalence usually increases [16,21]. Prevalence\n",
      "might be inﬂuenced by the sport and training goals of the speciﬁc population being screened [16],\n",
      "e.g., among body builders, prevalence rates of 100% were reported [22]. However, the few subjects\n",
      "indicating body building as their training goal in our study cannot explain our results. The relatively\n",
      "high purchasing power in Switzerland might also contribute to the comparatively high prevalence of\n",
      "supplement use, or is at least not a barrier.\n",
      "The median number of weekly supplement servings indicated that 50% consumed more than\n",
      "11 servings per week, while there was a subset of consumers with quite substantial supplement use,\n",
      "i.e., 10% took >40 supplements per week. The number of supplement servings per day or week has\n",
      "usually not been reported in other studies. This might be explained by the fact that other studies\n",
      "also used categorical variables to assess supplement intake frequency. To calculate a summed-up\n",
      "number of supplement servings, assumptions had to be made by allocating numbers to the categories.\n",
      "This is sometimes quite straightforward as for the categories “once a week” or “daily”, but may be\n",
      "aﬄicted with errors. Even for the seemingly straight forward category “daily”: If one serving per day\n",
      "is the assumption, this might be an underestimate as there was no category for a more frequent intake.\n",
      "Somebody taking several servings a day still could only mark “daily” intake. Hence, the calculated\n",
      "number of servings could likely be underestimated. Nevertheless, the number may represent an\n",
      "educated guess of the magnitude of supplement intake, which seems to be even more relevant than the\n",
      "mere prevalence of supplements in use. Future studies should focus more on this parameter to obtain\n",
      "more data about the scale of supplement intake and not only about the prevalence of supplement users,\n",
      "no matter the extent of use. Our data indicate that a signiﬁcant part of the supplement consumers is\n",
      "supplementing on a large scale, i.e., 31% use at least 20 supplement servings per week and 10% use 40\n",
      "or more supplement servings per week.\n",
      "Protein supplements represented the most prevalent products, which is in line with other\n",
      "supplement screening studies [19,23,24]. In line with others [4], we reported a more prevalent protein\n",
      "intake among men compared to women. This correlates with the more prevalent training goal of muscle\n",
      "and strength gain among men. We detected more prevalent protein and creatine supplementation\n",
      "among younger compared to older ﬁtness center users, whereas the opposite was found for vitamin\n",
      "supplementation. Other authors made similar observations [23] and it might reﬂect the diﬀerent\n",
      "training goals among age groups, i.e., more focus on strength and muscles among the younger and\n",
      "more focus on health among the older age groups.\n",
      "Comparable to other studies [4], we detected a positive correlation between training frequency\n",
      "and supplement usage. Nevertheless, the correlation is weak and is deﬁnitely not a predictor at the\n",
      "individual level. The subject with the highest supplement intake of 100 weekly servings was training\n",
      "only once a week.\n",

      "4.2. Information Sources\n",
      "Although athletes are generally not advised to consult friends, training peers or coaches as primary\n",
      "information sources about supplements [25], the present study population declared trainer, coaches,\n",
      "websites of supplement sellers, training peers, and family members or friends as the leading information\n",
      "sources. Trainers’ and coaches’ nutrition knowledge may be inadequate and peer experience is also\n",
      "unlikely to provide an evidence-based and individualized supplement regime [26–28]. Unfounded\n",
      "endorsement or encouragement of supplement use by inﬂuential individuals in the athlete’s circle\n",
      "such as coaches and training peers may also explain the relatively high supplement use in the present\n",
      "study [8]. Unﬁltered information from shared online videos and websites is obviously an inﬂuential\n",
      "source as well. Physicians and registered dietitians do not seem to be a predominant information\n",
      "source, which is in line with other studies [24].\n",
      "It is very plausible that this behavior increases safety risks for athletes [25], and that these\n",
      "information sources are insuﬃciently qualiﬁed or biased. Most supplements on the market are\n",
      "of limited value for consumers [8] and it is highly unlikely that a supplement seller will post any\n",
      "information that might curtail sales. Mislabeling and contamination of dietary supplements with\n",
      "undeclared substances, i.e., anabolic steroids, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals or stimulants with\n",
      "concomitant health risks represents a widespread problem in the supplement market [5,8].\n",
      "We detected an obvious discrepancy between the study participants’ selected information sources\n",
      "and their expectations regarding the information quality. The desire for evidenced-based information\n",
      "was in sharp contrast to the obviously nutritionally uneducated persons or entities chosen as primary\n",
      "information sources.\n",
      "This discrepancy may have two distinct reasons. Either the subjects are aware of the mismatch,\n",
      "but they are unwilling to close the gap, because the chosen resources are easily available and mostly\n",
      "free of charge (internet information, colleagues or the ﬁtness trainer provides nutrition and supplement\n",
      "recommendations as a side activity). Alternatively, the subjects are not aware of the mismatch and are\n",
      "therefore not able to bring their quality expectations in line with their behavior. This would indicate\n",
      "that people are largely unable to distinguish evidence-based information and educated professionals\n",
      "from nutritionally insuﬃciently educated information sources such as ﬁtness instructors, peers or\n",
      "supplier websites. This hypothesis might be supported by the observation that physiotherapists are\n",
      "used nearly as often as sources of information as dietitians or nutritionists, although there is obviously\n",
      "a dramatic nutritional education diﬀerence between these two paramedical professions.\n",
      "Those who designated themselves as being educated indicated, with few exceptions, courses that\n",
      "would not qualify somebody to provide substantiated nutrition and supplementation advice. On the\n",
      "one hand these persons might overestimate their own degree of knowledge and power of judgment.\n",
      "At the same time, these same individuals often serve as primary information sources for athletes\n",
      "(i.e., ﬁtness trainers working in the ﬁtness centers); customers obviously accept them as valuable\n",
      "information source.\n",
      "The Dunning-Kruger eﬀect refers to a cognitive bias in which individuals with a low level of\n",
      "knowledge in a particular subject mistakenly assess their knowledge or ability as greater than it is [29].\n",
      "This eﬀect may likely be attributed to the subjects who designated themselves as being educated in the\n",
      "ﬁeld, though the vast majority of them had no more than a few hours of nutrition training. In addition,\n",
      "it may be that personal experience with a product is mistaken for knowledge. This may relate to family\n",
      "members, friends, and training peers being accepted as trusted information sources.\n",
      "We may also speculate about so-called authority bias, the tendency to attribute greater accuracy\n",
      "to the opinion of an authority ﬁgure, unrelated to its content [30]. This may explain why ﬁtness\n",
      "instructors or physiotherapists are so often considered comparable to qualiﬁed dietitians.\n",
      "It becomes clear that taken together (family members, friends, and training peers), the predominant\n",
      "group of inﬂuential individuals regarding dietary supplementation is completely unqualiﬁed medically.\n",
      "In this case, it is likely that the trust that has been established in these individuals is mistaken for\n",

      "11 of 13\n",
      "Consequently, this study indicates signiﬁcant demand for identifying reliable information sources\n",
      "amongst our ﬁtness center users. In contrast to this study, a recent study with high level athletes\n",
      "aﬃliated with an Australian state-based sports institute indicated that nutritional and medical staﬀ\n",
      "were among the most inﬂuential sources of information regarding supplement use, while friends or\n",

      "support and might also be able to better diﬀerentiate between evidence-based professional advice\n",

      "If the information source about supplement intake risk was indicated by the\n",

      "supplement use.\n",
      "Although the questionnaire was not designed to evaluate the appropriateness of supplement\n",
      "use, there were several indications that supplements were used inappropriately. On the one hand,\n",
      "ineﬀective supplements such as fat burning products were used. At the same time, potentially eﬀective\n",
      "supplements such as creatine or beta-alanine were used only once a week, which cannot be eﬀective [9],\n",
      "indicating random supplement use. This may be a further consequence of insuﬃcient knowledge\n",
      "among the study population. Moreover, excessive use of supplements such as 100 supplement servings\n",
      "per week is rather unlikely to reﬂect a targeted supplement use.\n",
      "4.3. Limitations\n",
      "Certainly, this study has some limitations. Firstly, we could only screen a limited number of\n",
      "ﬁtness centers. Secondly, the overall response rate of 59% did not exclude a certain selection bias.\n",
      "Nevertheless, we managed to include more subjects than many other studies [4] and the available\n",
      "indicator (average age) does not speak against the hypothesis that the study population might more\n",
      "or less represent the population of the screened ﬁtness centers. Furthermore, the questionnaire was\n",
      "intentionally reduced to one two-sided A4 paper in order to keep it simple and short and with the\n",
      "intention to focus on return rate rather than on comprehensiveness. Therefore, the number of questions\n",

      "supplements by healthy people neither lowers their risk of cardiovascular diseases nor prevents\n",
      "the development of malignancies. Many scientiﬁc societies recognize that omega-3 fatty acids\n",

      "The number of people with excessive weight continues to rise, and ﬁghting obesity\n",
      "has become one of the greatest challenges of contemporary medicine. A person wishing to\n",
      "lose weight needs to undertake several difﬁcult life-changes and practice them consistently\n",
      "(diet, physical activity, addiction-free). Meanwhile dietary supplements are presented as\n",
      "a compelling alternative to traditional methods for combatting obesity. Wróbel-Harmas\n",

      "ments to be an effective method for losing weight [108], while in Poland these supplements\n",
      "are used by as many as 40–50% of young women, regardless of their weight [15].\n",
      "Weight loss supplements are usually multi-ingredient preparations, with over 4000 in-\n",
      "dividual substances used in the production process. The average weight loss supplement\n",
      "available in Western markets is estimated to include 10 different ingredients [109]. The\n",
      "more complex the recipe, the harder it is to determine its effects on the body. The most\n",
      "popular ingredients include chromium and chitosan, as well as green tea, Garcinia cambogia,\n",
      "and bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) extracts [15,16]. Over the years, no studies have shown\n",
      "that the use of either single- or multi-ingredient preparations of those substances promotes\n",
      "weight reduction.\n",
      "A 2013 meta-analysis of randomized studies found that chromium supplementation\n",
      "resulted in only 0.5 kg additional weight reduction in subjects with overweight and obesity,\n",
      "as compared with those taking a placebo [110], and a comparable result (mean: 0.75 kg)\n",
      "was achieved in a similar 2019 meta-analysis [111]. In addition, the literature indicates that\n",
      "chromium supplementation may be associated with several side effects: emesis, nettle-\n",
      "rash, and dizziness [112]. Claims about the beneﬁts of chitosan, which allegedly binds\n",
      "to fats in the digestive tract and inhibits fat absorption, are also exaggerated [113,114].\n",
      "A 2018 meta-analysis of randomized trials revealed that chitosan supplementation for\n",
      "approximately 17 weeks led to a slight decrease in body weight (mean: 1 kg) [113], and a\n",
      "similar result was found in a 2020 meta-analysis of similar studies, which reported a 0.89\n",
      "kg greater weight loss than those taking a placebo [115]. The effectiveness of green tea\n",

      "did not reinforce the weight loss process [116]; in light of other data, consumption of the\n",

      "does not meet the recommended levels for vitamins and minerals. However, the scientiﬁc\n",
      "literature shows that taking vitamins and minerals without medical justiﬁcation does not\n",
      "lower the risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer and that sometimes it can even have a\n",
      "negative effect. It should also be borne in mind that disease is inﬂuenced by many factors,\n",
      "both genetic and environmental, and a beneﬁcial change in one element of the diet may not\n",
      "have any overall effect. Popular positive expectations of supplements are also dampened\n",
      "by the fact that they are more often used by people who already eat better, lead a healthier\n",
      "lifestyle, are better educated, and have a greater health awareness [6,8,10]. Therefore,\n",
      "in such cases where the person already has a better nutritional status, including a lack\n",

      "term consumption of excessive quantities of these nutrients may, in fact, have detrimental\n",
      "side effects. The risk of such side effects increases when consumers take several dietary\n",
      "supplements at the same time (for example, “for immunity”, “for the heart”, or “for an\n",
      "efﬁcient mind”), as they may contain the same vitamins and minerals as each other.\n",
      "On the other hand, the beneﬁcial effect of using certain nutrients (omega-3 fatty\n",
      "acids) in the treatment of lipid disorders, as demonstrated in studies, undermines the\n",
      "registration of preparations intended for this purpose as dietary supplements. Dietary\n",

      "components with a physiological effect, and this group of preparations does not include\n",

      "17 of 24\n",
      "“therapeutic” doses of nutrients should not be used in food preparations. Moreover, Polish\n",
      "pharmaceutical law clearly emphasizes that in the case of a product that meets the criteria\n",
      "for classiﬁcation both as a medicinal product and as a dietary supplement, the provisions of\n",
      "pharmaceutical legislation, rather than food regulations, should be applied [147]. Currently,\n",
      "the dose of active ingredients is an important criterion in the registration process of dietary\n",
      "supplements [148]. It is also worth remembering that labeling and advertising of dietary\n",
      "supplements can neither imply nor make claims about the product’s preventive and/or\n",
      "therapeutic properties, which is consistent with food law and the regulations governing\n",
      "all foodstuffs [149]. Therefore, dietary supplement packaging may not contain informa-\n",

      "Unsurprisingly, the public often ﬁnds it difﬁcult to differentiate between supplements and\n",

      "disease” [9,128] on labels, unlike in the European Union. According to various authors,\n",
      "knowledge about supplements among some physicians and pharmacists also leaves much\n",
      "to be desired [155,156]. It is worth mentioning here that in Poland, considering the popular\n",
      "misconception that dietary supplements are drugs, as of 1 January 2020, self-regulation of\n",
      "TV broadcasting companies and supplement manufacturers [157] was introduced. The new\n",

      "screen: “Dietary supplement; contains ingredients which support physiological functions of the\n",
      "body by supplementing a typical diet; has no medicinal properties.”\n",
      "Considering the impact of dietary supplements on people’s health, it is important to\n",
      "remember that the results of short-term studies do not provide irrefutable data on their\n",
      "effectiveness and that even long-term studies, where lifestyle factors change over time and\n",
      "inﬂuence a person’s health, also pose a problem. When interpreting the results of research\n",
      "on intake of vitamin and mineral preparations, especially multivitamin–mineral supple-\n",
      "ments, it should also be remembered that there is a considerable degree of heterogeneity in\n",
      "supplement ingredients and amounts of nutrients because the composition of supplements\n",
      "is not directly regulated by law. Therefore, individual preparations may signiﬁcantly differ\n",
      "from each other in dose and composition of ingredients, thus affecting research results.\n",
      "In addition, it should be noted that administering vitamin and mineral supplements to\n",
      "the study group does not mean that the control group did not gain appropriate levels of\n",
      "these ingredients from their daily diets, and thus does not mean that the control group\n",
      "was at risk of hypovitaminosis. Therefore, identifying the potential beneﬁts of supplying\n",
      "nutrients in addition to the body’s normal requirements is difﬁcult.\n",
      "The author of this paper is aware of the limitations and issues in the cited studies and\n",
      "consequently is aware that this is not a systematic review. Therefore, it cannot be ruled\n",
      "out that some publications, possibly presenting different research results, may have been\n",

      "possible, including randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, and to discuss the\n",
      "individual issues in the paper in a balanced way, bearing in mind the length of the paper.\n",
      "Because of the widely different categories of dietary supplements, the article does not\n",

      "There is a growing overlap between conventional food\n",

      "wider when we consider functional foods and nutraceuticals.\n",

      "(active components) and the claims reported on its label [1].\n",
      "While the deﬁnition of a food supplement is quite clear\n",
      "and understandable (see Table 1), the deﬁnition of a\n",
      "nutraceutical is still in the grey area between food, food\n",
      "supplements and pharmaceuticals. The term nutraceutical, a\n",
      "syncretic neologism of the words nutrient and pharmaceutical,\n",
      "was originally coined by Stephen DeFelice, who deﬁned\n",
      "nutraceuticals as “food or part of a food that provides medical\n",
      "or health beneﬁts, including the prevention and/or treat-\n",
      "ment of a disease” [2]. This concept has been proposed as\n",
      "a modern approach to food science, and the area of possi-\n",
      "ble use has been deﬁned as beyond the diet, but before the\n",
      "drugs [3, 4]. Notwithstanding this concept, the deﬁnition\n",
      "of nutraceuticals and a legitimate assessment of their\n",
      "potential in medicine are still contradictory and far from\n",
      "being shared and accepted worldwide [5].\n",
      "The nutraceutical deﬁnition often overlaps with the\n",
      "accepted deﬁnition of food supplements [6, 7], and the\n",
      "rationale behind the use of these products is becoming\n",
      "more and more important in their distinction.\n",
      "Nutraceuticals are continuously developed and have\n",

      "effective use of these products, which are available on the\n",

      "properly be substantiated by scientiﬁc data on their safety,\n",
      "efﬁcacy and effect on health and/or pathological conditions.\n",
      "The claims are mainly unsubstantiated due to a lack of\n",

      "constituents (micronutrients); these studies are based on the\n",
      "assumption that micronutrients can be considered safe (or\n",

      "ingredient not sold before October 15, 1994, the manufacturer must notify the FDA and \n",
      "provide reasonable evidence that it is safe for human consumption (2).\n",
      "Dietary supplements are widely used. Half of adults in the US report having used at least \n",
      "one supplement in the past 30 days (3). The most cited reasons for taking the supplements \n",
      "were to improve overall health, maintain health, and, especially among women, for bone \n",
      "health. The most commonly used supplements were multivitamin/mineral supplements, \n",
      "calcium supplements, and omega-3/fish oil (3). About a quarter of the supplements were \n",
      "used based on advice by health care providers. Thus, most decisions to use supplements are \n",

      "vitamins will certainly cause deficiency diseases such as scurvy, beriberi, pellagra, and \n",
      "rickets. However, the vitamin content of normal well-balanced diets is sufficient to avoid \n",
      "these diseases. Studies aimed at determining effects of supplements often give conflicting \n",

      "VITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS\n",
      "By the early 20th century, it had become clear that nutrition consisting solely of \n",
      "carbohydrates, fats, and proteins is insufficient for maintaining health. The term “vitamine” \n",
      "was coined by Casimir Funk in 1912 to describe the micronutrients whose deficiencies cause \n",
      "beriberi, scurvy, and pellagra (5). As the various vitamins were isolated and synthesized, a \n",
      "market for vitamins quickly developed. Today, multivitamin/multimineral, vitamin and \n",
      "mineral supplements are the most widely utilized dietary supplements by the American \n",
      "population (3,6). It has been reported that 33% of US adults use multivitamin and/or \n",
      "multimineral supplements (7) and that this is as high as 32–47% among male military \n",
      "personnel and 40–63% among military women (8). Among long term cancer survivors, use \n",
      "of vitamin or mineral supplements is even higher at 64–81% (7). Although adequate intake \n",
      "of these micronutrients is required to maintain optimal health, the possibility of toxicity \n",
      "increases with increasing dose (9). Since dietary micronutrient deficiency is increasingly \n",
      "rare in developed counties, most supplement consumers actually have excess vitamin and \n",
      "mineral intake. Despite widespread belief that vitamin and mineral supplements are health \n",
      "beneficial, recent reviews of vitamin and mineral supplement trials in community-dwelling \n",
      "adults with no nutritional deficiencies have concluded that there is no clear evidence of \n",
      "beneficial health effects. These include primary or secondary prevention of chronic diseases \n",
      "including cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive decline and effects on overall mortality \n",
      "(10,11). Indeed, on the contrary, there is evidence for possible harm based on consumption \n",
      "of individual vitamins and mineral in excess. Toxicity following consumption of water-\n",
      "soluble vitamins is rare. However, photosensitivity and neurotoxicity have been reported at \n",
      "doses higher than 500 mg/d of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) (12) and cases of pyridoxine-\n",
      "associated chronic sensory polyneuropathy have been reported in elderly patients consuming \n",
      "multivitamin supplements (13). Reports of toxicity associated with overconsumption of \n",
      "supplemental antioxidant fat-soluble vitamins are more prevalent. Vitamin E is a family of 8 \n",
      "related tocopherols and tocotrienols of which α-tocopherol is the form generally used in \n",
      "supplements. Doses of 800–1200 mg/d can result in bleeding associated with antiplatelet \n",
      "action and doses above 1200 mg/d can result in diarrhea, weakness, blurred vision and \n",
      "gonadal dysfunction (12). Moreover, vitamin E supplementation following radiation therapy \n",
      "in a randomized trial of head and neck cancer patients was associated with increased cancer \n",
      "recurrence in the first 3.5 years of follow-up (14) and meta-analysis has suggested an \n",
      "increase in all-cause mortality after high dose vitamin E supplementation (15). Toxicity has \n",
      "also been associated with consumption of supplemental vitamin A and its provitamin \n",
      "carotenoid precursors. In two large clinical trials, the Retinol Efficacy Trial (16) and the \n",
      "ATBC study (17), male smokers receiving β-carotene supplements had significantly \n",

      "fracture risk (20). In addition, women consuming large amounts of vitamin A supplements \n",

      "chronic hypervitaminosis A after 12 years of supplement consumption which resolved after \n",
      "supplements were ceased (22). In addition to toxicity from excess vitamin consumption, \n",
      "toxicity can arise from excess consumption of minerals. In particular, there is an increasing \n",
