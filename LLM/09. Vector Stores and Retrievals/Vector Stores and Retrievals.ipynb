Integrating the TEMPA\\nframework further investigated the role of effort minimization in physical activity contexts. Through\\nan online questionnaire, data were collected from a sample of 250 fitness supplement-consuming\\nrespondents. SEM analysis revealed significant associations between behavioral intentions and\\nattitudes, perceived behavioral control, health motivation, and controlled precursors. However, it\\nwas seen that subjective norms, perceived effectiveness, perceived benefits, and automatic precursors\\nwere deemed insignificant.

Introduction\\nSupplementary drinks or fitness supplements are commonly used to enhance an\\nindividual’s performance in various sports and health settings, catering to both competitive\\nand non-competitive athletes [1]. One widely known supplement for athletes and fitness\\nenthusiasts is protein supplements like protein shakes. Others may be whey protein,\\ncaffeine, and creatine, to name a few. These supplements play a crucial role in helping\\nindividuals increase muscle mass, recover faster, and enhance their overall performance [2].\\nWhey protein stands out as a top-quality protein source, containing more essential amino\\nacids than traditional protein sources. Its numerous benefits have made it a popular choice\\nfor snacks and drinks among consumers [3]. Another widely embraced supplement is\\ncaffeine, which is found in many sports and food supplements. Caffeine reduces perceived\\neffort, minimizes fatigue and pain, and proves to be effective for endurance and high-\\nintensity activities, which is the choice of consumers [4].\\nCreatine monohydrate is another well-known supplement used to gain muscle mass\\nand support performance and recovery. It is known not to increase fat mass and remains\\neffective even when taken in recommended doses [5].

Branched-chain amino acids (BCAA) also offer\\na plethora of benefits for consumers. As explained by Sanz et al. [7], BCAAs are stored\\ndirectly in muscles and serve as the raw materials needed to build new muscle. This\\ncontributes to the overall process of strengthening muscles and alleviating post-workout\\nsoreness. Consumers often integrate these supplements into their routines with the aim of\\noptimizing the outcomes they wish to achieve and support overall well-being [1].\\nThe sports supplement industry makes for an impressive market share of nearly\\n$12 billion in the health/wellness portfolio and is projected to be worth $24.4 billion\\nby 2025. In a study by Burke [4], which investigated 20 published studies about the\\nprevalence, methods, and reasons for supplement consumption, it is evident from the\\nfindings that supplement consumption is prevalent among athletes and even more so in\\nindividuals competing at higher levels. It can also be confirmed that most gym-goers\\ngenerally use dietary supplements, with a prevalence exceeding 40%, with a prevalence of\\n44% in Portugal and 81% in South Africa [8]. In a set of different studies, the prevalence\\namong gym-goers ranged from 29.4% to 47.5%, and these findings remained consistent. It\\nwas also seen that among 55 Spanish basketball players and English elite track and field\\nathletes, the prevalence was 58% and 86%, respectively [9].\\nWhen investigating the dietary habits of combat sports athletes in the Philippines,\\nthe findings indicated that the overall knowledge of the respondents on nutrition and\\ndietary habits was exceptional. However, the understanding of individuals about the\\nexcess intake of vitamin and mineral supplements was poor [10]. Similarly, Elsahoryi\\net al. [11] assessed the trends on dietary supplements among students and found that\\nsupplements were deemed essential; however, their knowledge of them was concluded to\\nbe insufficient. The findings of these studies implicated a need for educational intervention\\non supplements. Furthermore, the presence of unlicensed and unsafe supplements poses\\na threat to uneducated consumers. The country’s Food and Drug Administration (FDA)\\nissued a strong public caution regarding the use of 11 dietary supplements in 2019. This\\nwas because the products have not undergone the regular evaluation process of the agency,\\nmaking it impossible to ensure the safety and quality of the items [12]. Additionally, the\\navailability of dietary supplements that claimed to help in weight loss has increased in\\ndrugstores and supermarkets. Many of these supplements contain various ingredients,\\ntypically herbs, vitamins, and minerals, caffeine, and laxatives, that when taken collectively,\\nhave unclear effects [13].\\nIndividuals leading luxurious lifestyles tend to exhibit a higher inclination toward\\nthe use of supplements [14], indicating a correlation between lifestyle and the tendency\\nto use supplements. Nagar [15] found attitude to be the most influencing predictor of\\nconsumers’ consumption intention of gym supplements, implying that customers’ attitudes\\ncan be affected by risk and benefits, social influence, and health consciousness. On the\\nother hand, Campbell et al. [16] highlighted perceived behavioral control as not highly\\ninfluenced by attitude and social norms. In another study, additional information on\\nlabels was found to significantly impact consumers’ behavioral intention to use dietary\\nsupplements [17]. The study further explained that consumers often consider using the\\nsupplement if its risks and benefits are well communicated on the label. It was also reported\\nthat customer consumption behavior with regard to fitness supplements is affected by\\ntheir comprehension of the side effects [18]. Moreover, it was indicated that knowledge\\nis a significant variable in consumers’ attitudes, beliefs, and intentions toward the use of\\nsupplements [19]. As knowledge grows, parallel improvement in understanding, belief,\\nand intention to use supplements is present.\\nJairoun et al. [20] suggested a positive perception regarding the use of fitness sup-\\nplements. That is, the consumption of fitness supplements has been perceived to lead to\\ndoping, and users demonstrate stronger intentions and attitudes toward it [21]. These\\nstudies highlighted the gap in proper education regarding supplements that can distort\\nindividuals’ ability to make informed and responsible choices about their consumption,'),\n",

Moreover, health behavior among consumers\\nwas barely addressed among the studies. It could be posited that scarce to no studies have\\nbeen conducted regarding fitness supplement consumption, especially in the Philippines,\\nwhere gym-goers and fitness enthusiasts are abundant [24]. The emphasis Filipinos place\\non both wellness and aesthetics has fueled a rise in gym participation nationwide. Conse-\\nquently, there has been a notable uptrend in the demand for nutraceuticals, such as protein\\nbars and powders, despite their higher costs [25].\\nThis study aimed to examine factors affecting the actual consumption of fitness supple-\\nments among health and fitness enthusiasts. This study employed a theoretical framework\\nthat combined the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB), the Health Belief Model (HBM), and\\nthe recently developed Theoretical Framework of Motivation to Pursue Exercise Activities\\n(TEMPA). By integrating these frameworks, this study provided a more holistic under-\\nstanding of the psychological and motivational factors that contribute to the consumption\\nbehavior and intention of fitness supplements. The significance of this study lies in its\\npotential to contribute insights to both academia and the health and fitness industry. Un-\\nderstanding the determinants of supplement consumption can aid in developing targeted\\ninterventions, educational programs, and marketing strategies to promote the responsible\\nand informed use of fitness supplements among enthusiasts, as well as enhancing overall\\nhealth and well-being. Furthermore, the incorporation of the framework represents a novel\\napproach to studying health-related behavior, offering a more nuanced perspective on the\\nintricate interplay of psychological, belief-based, and motivational factors in the context\\nof fitness supplement consumption, which could be applied and extended among other\\nrelated studies.\\n2. Conceptual Analysis and Hypotheses Build-Up\\nFigure 1 presents the conceptual framework of this study, integrating TPB, HBM, and\\nTEMPA. A total of 12 hypotheses were generated along with 12 latent variables. Among the\\ntheories, the TPB is said to be a frequently used behavioral model that aids in investigating\\nshifts in people’s behavior. This model operates on the premise that behavior is intentional,\\nenabling the prediction of actions [26]. On the other hand, the HBM is a well-researched\\nframework for understanding health behavior. It seeks to anticipate behavior related to\\nhealth by examining specific patterns of beliefs [27]. Lastly, several studies have employed\\nTEMPA to align with individuals’ physical efforts. TEMPA is a comprehensive model\\nassessing individuals’ tendency to engage in physical activities, incorporating factors that\\nmay promote their intentions [28].\\nDealing with TPB domains, several studies have justified the effects of behavioral\\nintention on up-taking dietary supplements. In this study, attitude refers to a disposition to\\nreact positively or negatively to a behavior [29]. It is evident in multiple studies that attitude\\nis a variable that has a significant impact on consumer’s behavioral intention. In context,\\nConner et al. [30] investigated the environmental influences that contributed to the decision\\nof women to use dietary supplements. The results showed that stronger intentions to use\\nsupplements were associated with positive attitudes. Liu et al. [31] assessed the effect of the\\nfear of COVID-19 on purchase behavior on dietary supplements. Their findings supported\\nthat attitude, which, alongside other behavioral parameters, significantly affected purchase\\nintention. Moreover, Nagar [15] examined the choice of gym supplements that gym-goers\\nwould purchase. The findings revealed that gym-goers’ intention to buy supplements is\\ninfluenced by their attitude, which is shaped by perceived risk and benefit, social influence,\\nand health consciousness.\\nOn the other hand, subjective norms represent an individual’s perception of others’\\nopinions regarding the execution of a particular behavior, affecting the intentions of Iranian\\nadolescent girls to intake iron and vitamin D supplements [32]. While Housman [33]\\nanalyzed the usage of sports-related supplements of elite female athletes, it was noted that\\ntheir perceptions were influenced greatly by the beliefs held by significant people around\\nthem. Participants expressed that the strongest influences on their behavior came from'),\n",

The findings of Haubenstricker [34] also stated that subjective\\nnorms and attitude were the most influential drivers in female bodybuilders’ intentions to\\nuse dietary supplements.\\n \\nFigure 1.

[35] conducted a study to investigate the attitudes and beliefs\\non dietary supplements among HIV-positive black women. The findings of the study\\nindicated that perceived behavioral control is a significant predictor of intention to use\\ndietary supplements. Similarly, Chen et al. [36] examined the effects of the perceived\\nbenefits of vitamin D supplementation intention. The results presented that the levels of\\nintention to take vitamin D supplements were accurately predicted by factors under the\\nTPB domains; the highest was perceived behavioral control. Pawlak et al. [37] investigated\\nthe drivers of multivitamin consumption in female Caucasian college students. Perceived\\nbehavioral control, along with attitude, were found to have a significant impact on their\\nbehavioral intentions. Thus, in this study hypothesized the following:\\nH1.

Hence, the following was hypothesized:\\nH4. Perceived effectiveness has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\\nMotivation for health involves an individual’s readiness to modify their behavior\\nfor the sake of enhancing their well-being [41]. In the study by Ataei et al. [42], it was\\nexplained that a significant influence of health motivation, among other factors, on farmers’\\nintentions to adopt green and safer pesticides was seen after they were aware of the benefits\\nof utilizing it. This signified that attitude toward health and the prevention of diseases is\\none of the main drivers to utilize the greener alternatives. Moreover, Sirico [43] observed\\nthat Italian students often consumed food supplements with a focus on overall well-being.\\nThey underscored that the respondents’ pursuit of maintaining good health is a priority.\\nLikewise, Kovács [44] found that leisure-time athletes primarily took supplements as a\\nproactive measure to maintain their health. These findings collectively highlighted the\\ntrend of individuals engaging in behaviors aimed at improving their health. Therefore, the\\nfollowing could be hypothesized:\\nH5. Health motivation has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\\nYazdanpanah et al. [45] found that the key factor influencing the intention to consume\\norganic food among Iranian young adults is the perceived health benefit. This suggests\\nthat individuals are inclined to choose organic foods due to their perceived health benefits\\nfor both themselves and the environment, thereby increasing the likelihood of choosing\\norganic options. In a similar vein, Saghafi-Asi [46] identified perceived benefits as a robust\\npredictor of weight management behavior, and Shitu [47] reported a positive correlation\\nbetween perceived benefits and preventive behavior against COVID-19. Thus, this study\\nhypothesized the following:\\nH6. Perceived benefit has a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\\nPerceived barriers, on the other hand, are the beliefs that carrying out a behavior is\\nrestricted due to psychosocial, physical, or financial factors. When assessing the predictors\\nof the intention to receive the COVID-19 vaccine, low perceived barriers were an important\\npredictor of a definite intention to take the vaccine [48]. Bhandari [49] found that perceived\\nbarriers negatively affected the safety behaviors of farmers to use safer pesticides and\\nadhere to safety behaviors; the findings indicated that educational programs and training\\nwere advised to mitigate the effect of these perceived barriers. Similarly, Pinho et al. [50]\\nfound that perceived barriers also had a significant effect on healthy eating. This suggests\\nthat individuals’ decision to carry out behaviors that positively affect health are significantly\\naffected by perceived barriers. To which, this study hypothesized the following:\\nH7. Perceived barriers have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\\nSelf-efficacy is one’s belief in being able to succeed in any task that they are given.\\nThis trait can be general or specific, allowing individuals to have a range of self-efficacy\\nabout themselves [51]. Upon investigating the relationship between dietary supplements\\nand the general self-efficacy levels of athletes, the findings showed that athletes with\\nlower self-efficacy tend to consume more supplements [52]. Broelz et al. [53] found that\\ngiving athletes a supplement with high salience caused them to work harder than products\\nwith low salience, underscoring the psychological benefit of supplements. Another study\\nfocused on ergogenic supplements’ effects on the performance of cycling athletes; they\\nhad a positive effect on the speed and endurance of the cyclists [54]. Similarly, López-\\nTorres et al. [55] discovered that the consumption of ergogenic supplements aided in\\nthe performance of female athletes and enhanced their efficacy to reach specific physical'),\n",

In addition, Gacek [56] investigated the determinants of nutritional\\nchoices of Polish handball players; it was found that self-efficacy and the consumption of\\nvegetables are positively correlated, thus indicating their belief in achieving specific goals.\\nEncompassing those associated with both health and sports, it underscores the importance\\nof a rational nutritional model. Thus, the following was hypothesized:\\nH8. Self-efficacy significantly affects automatic precursors.\\nH9. Self-efficacy significantly affects controlled precursors.\\nFor the precursors, TEMPA explains why individuals aspiring to engage in physical\\nactivity may not do so [57]. The framework considers both the automatic reactions triggered\\nby physical activity cues and the inherent desire to avoid exerting too much physical\\neffort. This explains that a person’s movements are swayed by automatic and controlled\\nprecursors. These precursors are triggered by the cues related to the movement, and how\\nindividuals feel about these cues was also said to affect the perceived effort that is needed\\nto perform the movement [58]. For these precursors to be effective and drive an individual\\nto engage in physical activity, the precursors supporting the intention should outweigh\\nthe negative precursors that reduce effort [28]. Ong et al. [24] exhibited that health and\\nwell-being are preceded by a person’s self-efficacy and its increase, which also increases\\ntheir behavioral intention. Thus, the following was theorized:\\nH10. Automatic precursors have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\\nH11. Controlled precursors have a significant direct effect on behavioral intention.\\nGoulet et al. [59] investigated the predictors of the use of performance-enhancing\\ndrugs (PED) among young athletes. To which, their study presented that all behavioral\\nfactors had a positive influence on behavioral intention. The results of the study suggested\\nthat psychosocial factors had a significant effect on their use of PEDs. In another study,\\nSamoggia and Rezzaghi [60] investigated the effect of the consumption of products that\\ncontain caffeine on sports performance. Behavioral intention was the dependent variable\\nin the study, presenting a positive outcome from the consumption of the products. Fur-\\nthermore, in a study investigating the role of education on the use of energy supplements,\\nMehri et al. [61] found that behavioral intention had the most significant impact. Educa-\\ntional interventions lowered the behavioral intention of the participants, which ultimately\\ndecreased the intake of the supplements. Relating to the positive results of studies, the\\nstudy hypothesized the following:\\nH12. Behavioral intention has a significant direct effect on the actual consumption of fitness supplements.\\n3. Methodology\\nParticipants\\nThe questionnaire was voluntarily answered by 250 respondents and was collected via\\na purposive sampling technique. The data collection period started in November 2023 and\\nfinished in February 2024, and respondents were composed of individuals residing in the\\nPhilippines who consume any kind of fitness supplement.

This implies that\\nconsumers benefit from investing in fitness supplements and emphasize the importance\\nand value of them. This is similar to the findings in the study by Liu [34], which highlighted\\nattitude as a significant factor affecting the intention to consume supplements because\\nconsumers see purchasing supplements as a sensible and helpful choice for them. In\\nanother study, Wathanakom [66] showed that individuals who perceive gym supplements\\npositively or associate them with health benefits or improved fitness are more inclined to\\nconsider using them.\\nSubjective norms were observed to have an insignificant impact on the behavioral\\nintention to consume fitness supplements (β: 0.021; p = 0.688). This indicates that the\\ndecision of individuals to purchase and consume fitness supplements is a choice based on\\ntheir own will and does not adhere to, nor is it influenced by, the standards or insights\\nof other individuals, whether it be people important to them or celebrities who endorse\\nthe supplements. This result is aligned with the findings of Kitcharoen and Vongurai [69],\\nwhose findings indicate that subjective norms did not have any direct influence on be-\\nhavioral intention to consume dietary supplements. It underscored how international\\ncompanies appoint social media influencers as their brand ambassadors in the hopes that\\nthese brand ambassadors will foster a positive outlook on dietary supplements, supposedly\\nincreasing an individual’s inclination to use dietary supplements. However, it contrasts\\nwith the studies by Alami [32], which underscored that the influence of friends, parents,\\nand teachers was significant in dietary behavior toward iron and vitamin D, as they served\\nas role models and provided social support. Moreover, Haubenstricker et al. [34], found\\nthat bodybuilders in in-season competitions are influenced by those around them, including\\ntrainers, workout partners, and social media influencers.\\nMeanwhile, perceived behavioral control significantly affected behavioral intention,\\nas well (β: 0.193; p = 0.004). Consumers exhibit a sense of control and ease over the con-\\nsumption of fitness supplements, viewing it as manageable and straightforward. Moreover,\\nthis indicates the voluntary nature of this choice, highlighting the individual’s sense of\\ncontrol and decision-making. This is consistent with the findings of Chen et al. [36], which\\nfound that perceived behavioral control was a significant driver in the intention to consume\\nvitamin D supplements, because individuals are more likely to engage in the consumption\\nof supplements if they find it easy to perform, and that past experiences with supplemen-\\ntation shapes perceived behavioral control, where positive experiences boost confidence\\nand negative ones create doubts. Additionally, Lino [35] also found that perceived be-\\nhavioral control had a significant impact on the intention to use dietary supplements; the\\nfindings indicated that individuals with a greater sense of control over the use of dietary\\nsupplements demonstrated stronger intentions to use them. This suggests that individuals\\nwho felt more in control of their treatment were more likely to express positive beliefs\\nand intentions regarding the use of dietary supplements. This is contrary to the findings\\nof Al-Swidi et al. [70], whose results indicated that perceived behavioral control had no\\nsignificant effect on the purchase intention of organic foods; the lack of significance of\\nperceived behavioral control in predicting organic food buying intentions in this study is\\nattributed to a combination of cultural factors, dependence on subjective norms, and the\\nemerging nature of the concept in the studied population.\\nIn this study, perceived effectiveness was found to have an insignificant effect on\\nbehavioral intention (β: −0.057; p = 0.429). Based on the constructs, this indicates that\\nconsumers do not deem fitness supplements as mandatory. The responses implied a\\nfrail view regarding the importance of using supplements for well-being, energy levels,\\nand daily performance. These findings are similar to Burke and Manore [71], which\\nstated that individuals whose diets provide adequate energy and nutrients can support\\nexercise performance and maintain nutritional intake without the need for supplements.\\nFurthermore, Jordan et al. [72] stated that micronutrient supplements are not mandatory\\nfor athletes who consume nutrient-dense food that provide high levels of energy, further\\nhighlighting the optionality of supplements. These results contrast those of Bussicott'),\n",

[73], who found that perceived effectiveness played a significant effect in shaping the\\nusage patterns of complementary medicine (CM) products. The reliance on information\\nfrom family and friends, coupled with the occurrence of adverse effects in more than\\nhalf of the participants, underscores the impact of perceived effectiveness on consumer\\nchoices. Despite potential risks and limited clinical evidence, CM weight-loss products\\nwere perceived as accessible, safe, and cost-effective.\\nPerceived benefits were seen to have an insignificant effect on behavioral intention\\n(β: −0.018; p = 0.717). Thus, respondents do not perceive the consistent intake of gym\\nsupplements as a preventive measure against health-related issues, which aligns with how\\nconsuming these supplements does not aid in building good health or contribute to an\\nindividual’s well-being. These findings are consistent with the study by Kiely et al. [74],\\nwhich investigated the health behaviors of individuals during the pandemic. It was found\\nthat perceived benefit had no statistical significance toward a change in exercise behavior;\\nindividuals’ perceptions of the benefits of exercise did not strongly correlate with their\\nactual exercise behavior changes. This implies that, at least in the context of the studied\\npopulation during the pandemic, people were more influenced by perceived barriers than\\nby their beliefs in the positive outcomes of exercise. Similarly, Rodrigues [58] stated that\\nindividuals consumed fitness supplements with the goal of gaining muscle, improving\\nrecovery, and enhancing performance. None have a correlation with health, as fitness\\nsupplements are not mandatory and are not endorsed to aid in the treatment of any health-\\nrelated issue. These results contrast with the findings of Ghai and Sharma [75], who\\nfound that perceived benefits, alongside trust, shaped satisfaction and the intention to\\npurchase organic food. Consumers who perceive benefits and have trust in organic foods\\nare more likely to express a willingness to pay premium prices and experience higher\\nsatisfaction levels. This is similar with the findings of Hoseini et al. [76], in which perceived\\nbenefits significantly affected the consumption of dietary supplements, with individuals\\nincorporating these products into their routines for various reasons. The desire for fitness,\\nphysical beauty, and skin health, alongside the intention to fill nutritional gaps and alleviate\\nthe side effects of micronutrient deficiencies, drives individuals to use supplements.\\nMoreover, health motivation significantly affected behavioral intention (β: 0.307;\\np < 0.001). Based on the constructs, respondents consume fitness supplements with mul-\\ntiple goals in mind, including increasing muscle mass, enhancing performance in fitness\\nactivities, meeting nutritional needs, and supporting the maintenance or initiation of a\\nhealthy lifestyle. They view fitness supplements as versatile tools with a range of posi-\\ntive impacts. The diverse reasons for consumption suggest a comprehensive approach\\nto health, encompassing not only physical well-being but also performance and lifestyle\\nconsiderations. Additionally, they see fitness supplements as instrumental in achieving\\nvarious health-related objectives, from muscle building and performance enhancement to\\nnutritional support and the promotion of a sustainable healthy lifestyle. This is aligned\\nwith the results of Sirico [46], which found that the enhancement of sport performance\\nand overall health and wellness are primary motivations for supplement use. Addition-\\nally, Kovács’ [44] study discovered that health preservation and physical well-being were\\nthe primary reasons for taking food supplements due to individual motivations, psy-\\nchological factors, and the recognition of the interconnectedness between nutrition and\\noverall well-being.\\nTehrani [77] found that diabetes patients with a history of CAM use demonstrated\\nfewer barriers to engaging in diabetes self-care behaviors. Therefore, mitigating perceived\\nbarriers increases the probability of an individual to engage in certain behavior. In relation\\nto the study, perceived barriers were seen to have an insignificant impact on behavioral\\nintention (β: −0.018; p = 0.717). The consumers do not express challenges related to ac-\\nquiring and consuming fitness supplements, specifically in terms of distance, cost, limited\\navailability, lack of motivation, and embarrassment as barriers. This indicates that con-\\nsumers have easy access to affordable fitness supplements, either due to the proximity\\nof stores, reasonable pricing, or the availability of cost-effective alternatives.

This result is consistent with the study by\\nFebian et al. [78], which found that individuals are inclined to consume functional food if\\nthey anticipate fewer barriers, such as difficult preparation and an unpalatable scent.\\nSelf-efficacy was seen to have a significant impact on automatic (β: 0.717; p < 0.001)\\nand controlled precursors (β: 0.705; p < 0.001). Fitness supplements aid in their confidence\\nin different aspects of exercise and achieving their fitness goals. They contribute positively,\\nwhich leads to greater adherence to routines, increased motivation, and overall fitness\\noutcomes. This is consistent with the findings of Zhao et al. [79], which were that self-\\nefficacy influences exercise behavior by boosting confidence in athletic abilities. Higher\\nexercise self-efficacy contributes to a more enjoyable and enduring engagement in physical\\nactivity, fostering a lifelong habit of sports. This has also verified the results of Gacek [56],\\nwhich revealed that individuals with higher self-efficacy engaged in behaviors that promote\\nhealth and enhance physical fitness, and they engaged less in behaviors that are detrimental\\nto their health, such as drinking alcoholic beverages.\\nThe results revealed that controlled precursors have a significant effect toward be-\\nhavioral intention (β: 0.272; p < 0.001), which based on the indicators, were voluntary\\nevaluation of the benefits of the supplements, matching their consumption with proper\\ndiet and exercise, recognizing their usefulness, and acknowledging the value of a healthy\\nlifestyle affect consumers’ intent to engage in activities that are aligned with fitness. This\\nimplies that controlled precursors prompt their intention to consume supplements suggest-\\ning that the precursors outweigh the impact of opposing processes that promote minimal\\neffort [28]. Moreover, controlled precursors are classified as advanced cognitive func-\\ntions, including reflective reasoning, that play a significant role in the decision-making\\nprocess [80]. This indicates that respondents evaluate activities based on the outcomes that\\ncome with performing the activity. This is evident in the study by Jagim et al. [81], which\\nfound that individuals consume pre-workout, which generally contained beta-alanine,\\ncaffeine, and creatine, to make workouts easier and improve their performance.\\nAutomatic precursors were observed to have an insignificant effect on behavioral\\nintention (β: 0.107; p = 0.206). These results suggest that the involuntary cues have little\\ninfluence over decision-making, indicating that respondents rely on conscious evaluation\\nand deliberation when considering whether to consume fitness supplements. They are\\nmore likely to weigh the pros and cons and consider their goals for their consumption [82].\\nThese results are inconsistent with the studies by Rodrigues [58], which found that past\\nbehaviors and autonomous motivation fostered by satisfaction and enjoyment were seen\\nto be significant predictors of future intentions to exercise. This suggests that habitual\\nactions influenced by past experiences may overshadow intentions in predicting future\\nbehavior. The insignificance of automatic precursors is consistent with the nature of\\nthis study because the decision to consume supplements is optional and heavily relies\\non the conscious evaluation aligned with an individual’s personal goals and nutritional\\nneeds. Based on the indicators, the findings depicted how habits and satisfaction from past\\nbehaviors are overshadowed by conscious considerations and external influences.\\nLastly, with behavioral intention as the mediating factor, it was seen to have a signifi-\\ncant role in actual consumption (β: 0.747; p < 0.001); respondents express the willingness to\\ncontinue purchasing fitness supplements and plan to use them to improve their health in\\nthe coming periods. Additionally, they plan to pay attention to the supplements they will\\nconsume and recommend to others. This indicates a positive perception of supplements,\\nwhich is a probable basis for the intention to continuously consume them for improving\\ntheir fitness and endorsing others to consume them, as well. This is consistent with the\\nresults of Nystrand and Olsen [64], which were that consumers’ behavioral intention to\\nconsume functional foods was shaped by factors such as attitude, self-efficacy, and sub-\\njective norms. This suggests that individuals are motivated to consume certain products,\\nas long as they perceive themselves as capable of doing so, and that social pressure from\\nindividuals of importance plays a pivotal role, as well.

Conclusions and Implications\\nThe study contributes to existing theories, such as the Theory of Planned Behavior\\n(TPB), Health Belief Motivation (HBM), and Theory of Effort Minimization in Physical\\nActivity (TEMPA), by providing empirical evidence of the factors influencing consumers’\\nintention to consume fitness supplements. This expands the understanding of how psycho-\\nlogical factors shape consumer behavior. The study highlights the importance of health\\nmotivation as the central driver of behavioral intention, suggesting that health-related\\ngoals play a significant role in shaping consumer decisions regarding supplement usage.\\nAdditionally, the study underscores the complexity of consumer decision-making processes,\\ndemonstrating the interplay between cognitive evaluation, self-efficacy, and automatic\\nprecursors in influencing behavioral intention. Through theoretical constructs discussed,\\nthe study provides a foundation for further research into the underlying mechanisms\\ndriving consumer behavior in the fitness supplement market, ultimately advancing the\\ntheoretical understanding of consumer decision-making.\\nThe findings of the study can be significant for the fitness supplement industry. Firstly,\\ncompanies should prioritize marketing efforts that highlight the benefits and ease of use of\\ntheir products, emphasizing factors such as effectiveness, convenience, and affordability to\\nappeal to consumers. Secondly, understanding the strong influence of health motivation,\\ncompanies can tailor their product offerings and marketing to align with consumers’ health\\ngoals and aspirations, thus enhancing the perceived value of their supplements. Thirdly,\\neducational interventions are crucial to address any misconceptions regarding supplement\\nusage, providing evidence-based information to build consumer trust and confidence.\\nAdditionally, companies can invest in strategies to enhance consumer self-efficacy, such\\nas providing resources and support to help consumers make informed decisions about\\nsupplement usage. Overall, by focusing on these managerial implications, companies can\\nbetter meet the needs and preferences of consumers, driving sales and fostering long-term\\nbrand loyalty in the competitive fitness supplement market. Future research may opt to\\nconsider more respondents as gaining more diverse demographic context, insights, and\\nperception, which may lead to other findings.\\nAuthor Contributions: Conceptualization, P.R.E., A.K.S.O., J.D.G., M.J.J.G. and E.S.C.; methodology,\\nP.R.E., A.K.S.O., J.D.G., M.J.J.G. and E.S.C.; software, P.R.E., A.K.S.O., J.D.G. and M.J.J.G.; validation,\\nP.R.E., A.K.S.O., J.D.G., M.J.J.G. and E.S.C.; formal analysis, P.R.E. and A.K.S.O.; investigation, P.R.E.,\\nA.K.S.O. and J.D.G.; resources, P.R.E., A.K.S.O., J.D.G., M.J.J.G. and E.S.C.; data curation, P.R.E.,\\nA.K.S.O. and J.D.G.; writing—original draft preparation P.R.E., A.K.S.O. and J.D.G.; writing—review\\nand editing, P.R.E., A.K.S.O., J.D.G., M.J.J.G. and E.S.C.; visualization, P.R.E., A.K.S.O., J.D.G., M.J.J.G.\\nand E.S.C.; supervision, J.D.G. and A.K.S.O.; project administration, J.D.G., A.K.S.O. and M.J.J.G.;\\nfunding acquisition, J.D.G. and A.K.S.O.

Introduction\\nAthletes are generally advised to follow a balanced diet adapted to the speciﬁc requirements of\\ntheir individual sport [1,2]. An increase in training volume requires an appropriate change in energy\\nand nutrient intake [3]. Additionally, many athletes add various supplements to their diet for a variety\\nof reasons [4,5]. Health-related reasons for taking supplements may apply to the general as well as to\\nthe athletic population. Additional factors, e.g., related to performance or training adaptation, may be\\npresent among athletes. Therefore, it is not surprising to ﬁnd a higher prevalence of supplement use\\namong athletes compared to the general population [4,6].\\nThere are diﬀerent deﬁnitions for supplements used in sport. Sports supplements are often\\ncategorized into sports food (i.e., products delivering macronutrients and energy), performance\\nsupplements (supplements which directly or indirectly inﬂuence performance), and medical\\nsupplements (to prevent or treat nutritional deﬁciencies) [7].\\nNutrients 2020, 12, 2595; doi:10.3390/nu12092595\\nwww.mdpi.com/journal/nutrients'),\n",

The regulations related to dietary\\nsupplements diﬀer signiﬁcantly across countries and many supplements on the international market\\nfail to meet expected safety and eﬃciency standards [5,7–11]. Supplements may be contaminated\\nwith a large array of substances, including non-declared anabolic steroids, stimulants or heavy\\nmetals [8,10–12]. Unsubstantiated claims made by manufacturers may misguide athletes and expose\\nthem to harmful health eﬀects [7,8,11].\\nScreening studies from around the world indicate the prevalence of supplement use among\\ndiﬀerent athlete populations to be variable [4]. Limited data are available for central Europe and in\\nparticular the German speaking area, i.e., Germany, Switzerland, and Austria [4]. Representative\\ngeneral population data from Germany indicate that 28% use dietary supplements [13], with a higher\\nprevalence among women (31%) compared to men (24%). A comparable prevalence (26%) was\\nreported from a cohort in Switzerland [6]. Other countries such as the US report higher prevalence rates\\ncompared to the Swiss or German data [14], suggesting variability in the prevalence of supplement use\\nacross countries.\\nSurveys generally indicate an increasing prevalence of supplement intake with age and in\\nathletes compared to the general population [4,6,10,13]. Among athletes, there is often an increased\\nprevalence with increasing training volume and higher performance level, i.e., elite vs. sub-elite or\\nrecreational athletes [4,5,15,16]. Braun et al. have published prevalence data among young German\\nelite athletes [16]. There are no supplementation data available from any kind of athletic or ﬁtness\\npopulations in Switzerland. The sports community is a diverse group including recreational gym-goers\\nto international-level elite athletes with likely diverse supplementation behaviors. Recreational health\\nand ﬁtness center users are probably one of the largest groups. About 16% of the Swiss Population is a\\nmember of a private ﬁtness center and holds a subscription for regular training sessions [17]. The goal\\nof the present study was to collect data about the prevalence of supplement use in ﬁtness center users\\nin Switzerland. In addition, motivation for supplement intake and information sources were examined.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\n2.1. Recruitment and Ethics\\nTen ﬁtness centers in the Bern region of Switzerland participated in this study (three being\\nbranches of the same company) and agreed to have their customers surveyed for the purpose of this\\nstudy. The participating centers included low budget as well as medium to high priced “premium”\\ncenters and represented a broad range of customers. Data collection was performed in February 2019\\nwith a quantitative questionnaire. The study sample was deﬁned as all customers entering the ﬁtness\\ncenters during screening time. Screenings were held according to study team access to the diﬀerent\\nﬁtness centers. In four ﬁtness centers screenings were held over one day (8 h per day). In the other\\nﬁtness centers screening occurred over two evenings (3 h per evening). Diﬀerent weekdays were\\nselected. Customers entering the ﬁtness centers were informed both orally and in writing about the\\nstudy goal. They were also notiﬁed that participation was voluntary, that placing the anonymous\\nquestionnaire in the anonymous collecting box was considered as informed consent to participate in the\\nsurvey, and that any question may be skipped or incomplete questionnaire returned. The collecting box\\nwas opened by the research team at the end of each screening day. All data were collected anonymously.\\nThe study was carried out in accordance with the Declaration of Helsinki.\\n2.2. Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria\\nInclusion criteria were: All customers who entered the ﬁtness centers during the time window of\\nthe screening in the respective ﬁtness center and who were at least 18 years old.'),\n",

Empty questionnaires and questionnaires of subjects\\nunder 18 years of age were excluded. Partially completed questionnaires were included, provided\\nthe second section (supplement intake) was completed. If the supplement intake section was not\\ncompleted the questionnaire was excluded.\\nLanguage restriction: The questionnaire was available in German only, representing the oﬃcial\\narea language and the corresponding language in the participating ﬁtness centers. A very small\\nminority of the customers might have been unable to participate due to language restrictions.\\n2.3. Questionnaire\\nThe quantitative questionnaire was divided into three sections on a single double-sided A4 sheet\\nof paper. In the ﬁrst section, categorical variables were screened, including gender, age group, training\\nfrequency per week (Table 1), and main training goals (i.e., support health, weight loss, body shaping,\\nbodybuilding, improve strength, improve endurance, improve sport speciﬁc performance, other\\nreasons). In the second section, the supplement use was screened by listing 25 predeﬁned substances\\nand product classes (Table 2). Spare lines were available to list “further” products not included in the\\nquestionnaire. For each product, intake frequency had to be indicated. The available categories were\\n“daily”, “several times per week”, “once a week”, “less than once a week”, “never”, and “don’t know”.\\nIn the last section, subjects were asked about their motivation to take the supplements, where they\\ninformed themselves about the supplements used, whether they were informed about potential side\\neﬀects or risks by their information source (yes or no) and what they considered to be important criteria\\nwhen selecting the particular information source(s). For these questions, a limited set of predeﬁned\\nanswers was presented (see the corresponding tables and ﬁgures in the result section) including an\\nopen answer to insert further individual responses. For some predeﬁned answers, a dependent open\\nquestion was added. For example, one answer for the question about the used information sources\\nwas “I took courses on the subject “. In this case, the participants were asked what kind of course they\\ncompleted. In order to limit the required time to ﬁll in the questionnaire and to optimize response rate\\nas much as possible, the questionnaire and the predeﬁned answers were intentionally limited to one\\nsingle double-sided page.

Supplement Intake\\nThe aim of this study was to gain insight into the prevalence of supplement intake and used\\ninformation sources among recreational ﬁtness center users in Switzerland. Overall, 82% of the ﬁtness\\ncenter users consumed supplements. This prevalence is higher compared to a general population\\nsample in Switzerland, where only 26% used supplements [6]. It is also higher in comparison with\\nﬁtness athlete populations from other countries and cultural regions [4,18–20], and even compared\\nto reports from some elite athlete populations [4,16]. The deﬁnition of supplements and supplement\\nuse diﬀers across studies, i.e., intake prevalence depends on whether or not subjects are asked about\\ntheir current intake, which is often deﬁned as the last four weeks as in the present study [4,16].\\nWhen subjects are asked for longer timeframes, the prevalence usually increases [16,21]. Prevalence\\nmight be inﬂuenced by the sport and training goals of the speciﬁc population being screened [16],\\ne.g., among body builders, prevalence rates of 100% were reported [22]. However, the few subjects\\nindicating body building as their training goal in our study cannot explain our results. The relatively\\nhigh purchasing power in Switzerland might also contribute to the comparatively high prevalence of\\nsupplement use, or is at least not a barrier.\\nThe median number of weekly supplement servings indicated that 50% consumed more than\\n11 servings per week, while there was a subset of consumers with quite substantial supplement use,\\ni.e., 10% took >40 supplements per week. The number of supplement servings per day or week has\\nusually not been reported in other studies. This might be explained by the fact that other studies\\nalso used categorical variables to assess supplement intake frequency. To calculate a summed-up\\nnumber of supplement servings, assumptions had to be made by allocating numbers to the categories.\\nThis is sometimes quite straightforward as for the categories “once a week” or “daily”, but may be\\naﬄicted with errors. Even for the seemingly straight forward category “daily”: If one serving per day\\nis the assumption, this might be an underestimate as there was no category for a more frequent intake.\\nSomebody taking several servings a day still could only mark “daily” intake. Hence, the calculated\\nnumber of servings could likely be underestimated. Nevertheless, the number may represent an\\neducated guess of the magnitude of supplement intake, which seems to be even more relevant than the\\nmere prevalence of supplements in use. Future studies should focus more on this parameter to obtain\\nmore data about the scale of supplement intake and not only about the prevalence of supplement users,\\nno matter the extent of use. Our data indicate that a signiﬁcant part of the supplement consumers is\\nsupplementing on a large scale, i.e., 31% use at least 20 supplement servings per week and 10% use 40\\nor more supplement servings per week.\\nProtein supplements represented the most prevalent products, which is in line with other\\nsupplement screening studies [19,23,24]. In line with others [4], we reported a more prevalent protein\\nintake among men compared to women. This correlates with the more prevalent training goal of muscle\\nand strength gain among men. We detected more prevalent protein and creatine supplementation\\namong younger compared to older ﬁtness center users, whereas the opposite was found for vitamin\\nsupplementation. Other authors made similar observations [23] and it might reﬂect the diﬀerent\\ntraining goals among age groups, i.e., more focus on strength and muscles among the younger and\\nmore focus on health among the older age groups.\\nComparable to other studies [4], we detected a positive correlation between training frequency\\nand supplement usage. Nevertheless, the correlation is weak and is deﬁnitely not a predictor at the\\nindividual level. The subject with the highest supplement intake of 100 weekly servings was training\\nonly once a week.'),\n",

Information Sources\\nAlthough athletes are generally not advised to consult friends, training peers or coaches as primary\\ninformation sources about supplements [25], the present study population declared trainer, coaches,\\nwebsites of supplement sellers, training peers, and family members or friends as the leading information\\nsources. Trainers’ and coaches’ nutrition knowledge may be inadequate and peer experience is also\\nunlikely to provide an evidence-based and individualized supplement regime [26–28]. Unfounded\\nendorsement or encouragement of supplement use by inﬂuential individuals in the athlete’s circle\\nsuch as coaches and training peers may also explain the relatively high supplement use in the present\\nstudy [8]. Unﬁltered information from shared online videos and websites is obviously an inﬂuential\\nsource as well. Physicians and registered dietitians do not seem to be a predominant information\\nsource, which is in line with other studies [24].\\nIt is very plausible that this behavior increases safety risks for athletes [25], and that these\\ninformation sources are insuﬃciently qualiﬁed or biased. Most supplements on the market are\\nof limited value for consumers [8] and it is highly unlikely that a supplement seller will post any\\ninformation that might curtail sales. Mislabeling and contamination of dietary supplements with\\nundeclared substances, i.e., anabolic steroids, pharmaceuticals, heavy metals or stimulants with\\nconcomitant health risks represents a widespread problem in the supplement market [5,8].\\nWe detected an obvious discrepancy between the study participants’ selected information sources\\nand their expectations regarding the information quality. The desire for evidenced-based information\\nwas in sharp contrast to the obviously nutritionally uneducated persons or entities chosen as primary\\ninformation sources.\\nThis discrepancy may have two distinct reasons. Either the subjects are aware of the mismatch,\\nbut they are unwilling to close the gap, because the chosen resources are easily available and mostly\\nfree of charge (internet information, colleagues or the ﬁtness trainer provides nutrition and supplement\\nrecommendations as a side activity). Alternatively, the subjects are not aware of the mismatch and are\\ntherefore not able to bring their quality expectations in line with their behavior. This would indicate\\nthat people are largely unable to distinguish evidence-based information and educated professionals\\nfrom nutritionally insuﬃciently educated information sources such as ﬁtness instructors, peers or\\nsupplier websites. This hypothesis might be supported by the observation that physiotherapists are\\nused nearly as often as sources of information as dietitians or nutritionists, although there is obviously\\na dramatic nutritional education diﬀerence between these two paramedical professions.\\nThose who designated themselves as being educated indicated, with few exceptions, courses that\\nwould not qualify somebody to provide substantiated nutrition and supplementation advice. On the\\none hand these persons might overestimate their own degree of knowledge and power of judgment.\\nAt the same time, these same individuals often serve as primary information sources for athletes\\n(i.e., ﬁtness trainers working in the ﬁtness centers); customers obviously accept them as valuable\\ninformation source.\\nThe Dunning-Kruger eﬀect refers to a cognitive bias in which individuals with a low level of\\nknowledge in a particular subject mistakenly assess their knowledge or ability as greater than it is [29].\\nThis eﬀect may likely be attributed to the subjects who designated themselves as being educated in the\\nﬁeld, though the vast majority of them had no more than a few hours of nutrition training. In addition,\\nit may be that personal experience with a product is mistaken for knowledge. This may relate to family\\nmembers, friends, and training peers being accepted as trusted information sources.\\nWe may also speculate about so-called authority bias, the tendency to attribute greater accuracy\\nto the opinion of an authority ﬁgure, unrelated to its content [30]. This may explain why ﬁtness\\ninstructors or physiotherapists are so often considered comparable to qualiﬁed dietitians.\\nIt becomes clear that taken together (family members, friends, and training peers), the predominant\\ngroup of inﬂuential individuals regarding dietary supplementation is completely unqualiﬁed medically.\\nIn this case, it is likely that the trust that has been established in these individuals is mistaken for\\nprofessional expertise.'),\n",

In contrast to this study, a recent study with high level athletes\\naﬃliated with an Australian state-based sports institute indicated that nutritional and medical staﬀ\\nwere among the most inﬂuential sources of information regarding supplement use, while friends or\\nsupplement supplier information were rated as least inﬂuential [31]. This might indicate that athletes\\nin close contact with professional support might have and accept more inﬂuence from professional\\nsupport and might also be able to better diﬀerentiate between evidence-based professional advice\\nand lay information. Another reason might be the athlete’s performance level. An Australian study\\nreported that non-elite athletes are more likely to choose the internet and less likely to choose a dietitian\\nor nutritionist as primary information sources compared to elite athletes [32]. Overall, the internet\\n(47%), trainers (42%), and family/friends (37%) were the leading “top 3” information sources amongst\\na range of elite and non-elite Australian athletes. However, dietitians (41%) and nutritionists (37%)\\nwere also frequently named in the ‘top 3’ information sources [32]. This is diﬀerent to our gym-going\\nhealth and ﬁtness athletes where dietitians and nutritionists together were named by just 5.7%. As the\\nathletic level of our gym-goers was very likely even lower than the non-elite Australian athletes, the\\nobservation that the level of athleticism might be one possible predictor for poor information source\\nchoice, would be supported by our data.\\nThe low percentage (37%) of the study population who informed themselves or were informed\\nabout risk factors associated with dietary supplement intake may also be a consequence of the largely\\nuneducated or unqualiﬁed information sources considered. Importantly, we only asked whether\\nor not information about the risks had been given. We did not evaluate whether the information\\nwas appropriate.\\nIf the information source about supplement intake risk was indicated by the\\nsubjects, sources such as the Internet, YouTube, and ﬁtness instructors were again frequently named.\\nConsequently, it is likely that many of the 37% were informed in an unfounded manner regarding risk\\nfactors. Therewith, this study clearly indicates insuﬃcient safety knowledge among these product\\nusers and a need for broad information dissemination about potential risks associated with dietary\\nsupplement use.\\nAlthough the questionnaire was not designed to evaluate the appropriateness of supplement\\nuse, there were several indications that supplements were used inappropriately. On the one hand,\\nineﬀective supplements such as fat burning products were used. At the same time, potentially eﬀective\\nsupplements such as creatine or beta-alanine were used only once a week, which cannot be eﬀective [9],\\nindicating random supplement use. This may be a further consequence of insuﬃcient knowledge\\namong the study population. Moreover, excessive use of supplements such as 100 supplement servings\\nper week is rather unlikely to reﬂect a targeted supplement use.\\n4.3. Limitations\\nCertainly, this study has some limitations. Firstly, we could only screen a limited number of\\nﬁtness centers. Secondly, the overall response rate of 59% did not exclude a certain selection bias.\\nNevertheless, we managed to include more subjects than many other studies [4] and the available\\nindicator (average age) does not speak against the hypothesis that the study population might more\\nor less represent the population of the screened ﬁtness centers. Furthermore, the questionnaire was\\nintentionally reduced to one two-sided A4 paper in order to keep it simple and short and with the\\nintention to focus on return rate rather than on comprehensiveness. Therefore, the number of questions\\nand the number of predeﬁned answers per question were limited. This might have inﬂuenced the\\nanswers to some degree.\\n5. Conclusions\\nIn conclusion, this study indicates a high prevalence of supplement use among Swiss ﬁtness center\\nusers. The high use was associated with a low level of information quality. We detected a striking\\ndiscrepancy between an obvious desire for high quality evidence-based information and a blatant'),\n",

The aim of this scoping review is to present what is known\\nabout the effects of using selected dietary supplements in the context of chronic diseases, as well\\nas the risks associated with their use. The literature shows that the taking of vitamin and mineral\\nsupplements by healthy people neither lowers their risk of cardiovascular diseases nor prevents\\nthe development of malignancies. Many scientiﬁc societies recognize that omega-3 fatty acids\\nlower blood triglycerides, but whether taking them prevents heart disease is less clear-cut. Taking\\nweight loss supplements is not an effective method of ﬁghting obesity. Often, some supplements\\nare increasingly sold illegally, which is then also associated with the higher risk that they may\\nbe adulterated with banned substances, thus making them even more dangerous and potentially\\nlife-threatening. Supplements are necessary in cases of nutrient deﬁciency; however, even though\\nprescription is not required, their use should be recommended and monitored by a physician.\\nKeywords: dietary supplements; legal regulations; health; safety\\n1. Introduction\\nIn accordance with the European Union law, as well as the United States law, dietary\\nsupplements mean products that are concentrated sources of vitamins, minerals, or other\\nsubstances with a nutritional or physiological effect (e.g., amino acids, essential fatty acids,\\nprobiotics, plants, and herbal extracts) intended to supplement the regular diet. Dietary\\nsupplements are produced in the form of capsules, tablets, pills, and other similar forms,\\ndesigned to be taken in measured small unit quantities [1,2]. Dietary supplements, despite\\ntheir route of administration and drug-like appearance, have been classiﬁed as foodstuffs\\nand not medicines. Thus, in formal terms, supplement users are consumers rather than\\npatients, but the question remains whether it is sick or healthy individuals who should\\nbe the primary users. The market for dietary supplements continues to expand at a rapid\\npace, and manufacturers develop products for health problems affecting almost all organs\\nof the body, as well as for non-existing conditions, e.g., supplements for bladder elasticity.\\nAdditionally, a growing awareness among the public about the role of nutrition in the\\nmaintenance of health, together with widespread beliefs about today’s food being poor in\\nvitamins (e.g., due to impoverished soil), are among the reasons for dietary supplement\\nuse becoming common practice or even the norm.\\nSkyrocketing sales of supplements in times of the widespread accessibility and over-\\nconsumption of a wide range of foods may be described as the “supplement use phe-\\nnomenon”. In the US, over 50% of adults declare supplement use, and in some studies\\nalmost 40% had taken dietary supplements during the previous 30 days when they were\\nquestioned [3,4]. In Poland, supplement use has been reported by 30–78% of adolescents\\nand adults [5–7] and by approximately 40% of children [8]. Only one-quarter of supplement\\nInt. J. Environ. Res.

The primary reasons for supple-\\nment use in the United States are for overall health and wellness and to ﬁll nutrient gaps in\\nthe diet [10], while in Poland, among the elderly it is a need to boost the immune system,\\nand among younger people, use is related to improving the health and condition of skin\\nand hair [7]. Moreover, more than 40% of Poles surveyed believe that taking vitamin and\\nmineral supplements prevents diseases in healthy people, and almost 70% claim that the\\nuse of antioxidants prevents the development of cancers [11,12].\\nDue to the scale of supplement use, it is prudent to investigate whether and to what\\nextent nutrient supplementation has beneﬁcial effects and whether it lowers the risk of\\ndeveloping modern diseases. The aim of this scoping review is to present the state of\\nknowledge about the effects of using selected dietary supplements in the context of the risk\\nof developing non-communicable diseases typical of industrial societies, i.e., cardiovascular\\ndiseases, malignancies, and obesity, as well as supplements’ possible treatment-supporting\\neffects. Additionally, supplement safety, including their contamination with banned sub-\\nstances, is discussed.\\n2. Materials and Methods\\nIn view of the vast quantities of supplements of different compositions and purposes,\\nthe author chose to review published scientiﬁc research on the most frequently taken\\ndietary supplements, both in Poland and worldwide, which are primarily vitamins and\\nminerals, followed by omega-3 fatty acids [5,7,13,14]. In the case of dietary supplements\\nfor weight loss, the most used ingredients were considered, i.e., chromium, chitosan, green\\ntea extract, bitter orange, and Garcinia cambogia [15,16].\\nArticles written in English were searched in PubMed and Medline using keywords\\n(such as “dietary supplement”, “food supplement”, “vitamin–mineral preparations”, “vi-\\ntamins”, “minerals”, “omega-3 fatty acids”, “weight loss supplements”, “chromium”,\\n“chitosan”, “green tea extract”, “bitter orange” (Citrus aurantium), and “Garcinia cambogia”\\naccompanied by the names of speciﬁc diseases (cardiovascular diseases, cancers, obesity)\\nor the terms “safety” or “adulteration”. This article mainly covers publications from the\\nlast decade, including randomized placebo-controlled trials, meta-analyses of such trials,\\nand other original studies, as well as position statements by scientiﬁc societies. Due to the\\nbreadth of the issue, the literature review was limited to those studies involving adults,\\nexcluding studies on pregnant women.\\n3. Results\\n3.1. Dietary Supplements and Cardiovascular Diseases\\nFatty saltwater ﬁsh, fruit, and vegetables are the most common dietary components\\ncontributing to cardiovascular disease prevention. The literature offers conclusive evidence\\nthat a high intake of omega-3 fatty acids from ﬁsh and seafood lowers the risk of cardio-\\nvascular disease incidence and mortality [17,18] and that disease incidence is inversely\\ncorrelated with fruit and vegetable consumption [19,20].\\n3.1.1. Polyunsaturated Omega-3 Fatty Acids\\nThe beneﬁcial effect of omega-3 fatty acids, especially eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA),\\nand docosahexaenoic acid (DHA), consists in their ability to reduce triglyceride concentra-\\ntion and to lower arterial pressure, as well as to inhibit inﬂammatory process and blood\\ncell aggregation [17,21]. The well-documented importance of ﬁsh in the prevention of\\ncardiovascular diseases resulted in a speedy market reaction and release of ﬁsh oil nu-\\ntraceuticals. The question remains whether taking marine omega-3 fatty acid preparations\\nis as beneﬁcial as consuming marine omega-3 fatty acid foods and whether they may\\nbecome an alternative product for people who do not consume ﬁsh.\\nRegarding the primary prevention of cardiovascular disease, the results of two large,\\nrandomized trials from recent years should be cited ﬁrst. One of them is the British'),\n",

This study showed no signiﬁcant difference in the primary endpoints (i.e., non-\\nfatal myocardial infarction, stroke, transient ischemic attack, or vascular death) or the\\nsecondary endpoints (ﬁrst serious vascular event or any arterial revascularization) between\\nthe study and control groups. The authors concluded that the results of their study did\\nnot show that omega-3 fatty acids supplementation prevents vascular events [22]. In an\\nAmerican trial, the VITAL study, conducted with a group of 25,871 healthy individuals\\naged ≥50 years, results revealed that consumption of 1 g of ﬁsh oil/day (840 mg EPA and\\nDHA) for a median of 5.3 years did not lower the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, or\\noverall cardiovascular mortality in the study group compared with the placebo group [23].\\nStudies have also assessed omega-3 fatty acid supplementation in relation to sec-\\nondary prevention. The REDUCE-IT Clinical Trial showed that administration of highly\\npuriﬁed EPA ethyl ester (icosapent ethyl) at 4 g (2 g, twice daily) for a median of 4.9 years\\nto patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease or diabetes, who have elevated\\ntriglycerides and are treated with statins, reduced the risk of cardiovascular death, non-\\nfatal myocardial infarction, non-fatal stroke, coronary revascularization, or unstable angina\\nby 25%, compared with placebo, and reduced the risk of the secondary endpoint (cardio-\\nvascular death, non-fatal myocardial infarction, or non-fatal stroke) by 26%. The authors\\nemphasized that the beneﬁts demonstrated in their study should not be transferred to all\\nomega-3 preparations, especially dietary supplements, due to the differences between the\\ncomposition of supplements compared with the preparation used in their study [24]. The\\nliterature also shows that 4 g of icosapent ethyl improves the lipid proﬁle in patients with\\nstatin intolerance [25]. Many other experts also emphasize that omega-3 fatty acids (of\\nproven quality) may be particularly beneﬁcial for statin-intolerant patients with obesity,\\ndiabetes, or metabolic syndrome in whom elevated LDL cholesterol is accompanied by\\nhigh levels of triglycerides [26].\\nHowever, the STRENGTH randomized clinical trial of 2020 did not provide optimistic\\nresults. In that study, administration of 4 g of an omega-3 preparation with increased\\nbioavailability (carboxylic acid formulation of EPA and DHA) to high cardiovascular risk\\npatients treated with statins for more than 3 years proved of no beneﬁt in terms of major\\ncardiovascular events, and this ﬁnding resulted in early termination of the study [27].\\nAs experts point out, such divergent results of single studies may result from different\\nproportions of individual fatty acids in the preparations, the doses of the preparations,\\nthe length of the study, or the varying initial concentrations of omega-3 in the blood of\\nthe patients [28].\\nTo obtain clearer data in such situations, conclusions from meta-analyses of random-\\nized controlled trials are typically used, and though these have been quite numerous in\\nthe past 10 years, their results do not provide sufﬁcient evidence to form an unambiguous\\nconclusion. The ﬁndings of three 2012 meta-analyses showed that omega-3 fatty acid\\nsupplementation did not lower the risk of myocardial infarction, stroke, cerebrovascular\\nevents, cardiovascular mortality [29,30], or cardiovascular incidents in patients with exist-\\ning cardiovascular diseases [31]. A meta-analysis published one year later revealed that\\nsupplementation with omega-3 fatty acids reduced the risk of myocardial infarction by\\n25% and the risk of cardiac death by 32% in patients with cardiovascular diseases [32],\\nwhile a meta-analysis published in 2014 reported a 12% reduction in death from cardiac\\ncauses in patients with coronary heart disease who took omega-3 fatty acids [33]. In turn,\\na 2018 meta-analysis of randomized studies of omega-3 fatty acids taken, showed no\\neffects on non-fatal myocardial infarction, coronary heart disease events, or major vas-\\ncular events [34], a ﬁnding that is consistent with another 2018 meta-analysis that also\\nshowed no relationship between omega-3 fatty acids consumption and lowered risk of\\ncardiovascular disorders [35]. In contrast, the results of one of two 2019 meta-analyses of\\nrandomized clinical trials showed that taking omega-3 fatty acids reduced the risk of major'),\n",

The second 2019 meta-analysis of the studies, from which the\\nREDUCE-IT study was excluded because of the comparatively high level of its omega-3\\ndose, showed that omega-3 supplementation was associated with lower risk of myocardial\\ninfarction by 8%, total coronary heart disease by 5%, coronary heart disease death by 8%,\\nand cardiovascular death by 7% [37]. Further evidence of the beneﬁcial effect of omega-3\\nfatty acids in reducing cardiovascular risk is also found in the results of two meta-analyses\\nfrom 2020 [38,39], although there was also an associated higher risk of bleeding events and\\natrial ﬁbrillation events in some instances [39].\\nAgainst the background of the current state of scientiﬁc knowledge, what are the posi-\\ntions of the scientiﬁc societies responsible for recommendations to the medical community?\\nThe International Lipid Expert Panel (ILEP) stated in 2017 that omega-3 fatty acids are\\nproven to lower triglycerides (scientiﬁc evidence: class I, level A) [40,41] and added to this\\nview in 2020 by indicating the need for EPA and DHA supplementation in heart failure,\\nespecially in patients after myocardial infarction [42]. According to the ILEP, omega-3 fatty\\nacids in doses of 1–4 g daily reduce triglyceride levels by 18–25% [40]. The European Society\\nof Cardiology (ESC) and the European Atherosclerosis Society (EAS) both state that doses\\nof 2–3 g reduce triglyceride levels by about 30% [43]. The European Society of Cardiology\\nand other societies on cardiovascular disease prevention in clinical practice, as of 2019, did\\nnot recommend omega-3 fatty acid supplementation for cardiovascular diseases prevention\\ndue to the lack of reliable proof of its beneﬁcial effects [20]. Meanwhile, the 2019 American\\nCollege of Cardiology/American Heart Association guideline on the primary prevention\\nof cardiovascular disease makes no mention of omega-3 fatty acids [44], which should\\nbe understood as a lack of support for their use. The American Heart Association stated\\nin 2017 that supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids would be beneﬁcial in patients with\\ncoronary heart disease (CHD), including those after heart attack, as it may lower the risk of\\nCHD-related mortality by 10% [45].\\nIn conclusion, research ﬁndings on the impact of omega-3 fatty acid supplementa-\\ntion on the risks or beneﬁts in relation to the treatment of cardiovascular diseases vary\\nsigniﬁcantly. However, there are many indications that taking omega-3 fatty acid prepa-\\nrations by healthy people do not have such beneﬁcial effects as eating the same fats in\\nﬁsh. Therefore, consumption of omega-3 capsules does not offer an easy way to improve\\nnutrition and, apparently, cannot serve as a substitute for ﬁsh and seafoods in the diet.\\nImportantly, recent years have brought a growing number of reports about low-quality\\nﬁsh oil supplements [46], which according to various authors are nowhere near as good as\\npreparations registered as medicines [47]. In New Zealand, as many as 83% of supplements\\ncontaining ﬁsh oils were shown to exceed permissible levels of peroxides, which are an\\nindicator of fat deterioration [48]; similarly, in the US, oxidized fatty acids, cholesterol, and\\ntoxins were found in many omega-3 supplements [49]. In Poland, there is a wide range\\nof supplement products on the market containing omega-3 fatty acids and, as is the case\\nthroughout the European Union, there is no legal requirement for standardization of such\\npreparations regarding individual fatty acids content [21]. Currently, however, there are no\\ndata on the contamination of such preparations in Poland.\\n3.1.2. Vitamins and Minerals\\nVitamins and minerals are essential substances that our bodies need for optimal\\nfunctioning. As there is a considerable selection of vitamin and mineral supplements, it\\nseems prudent to consider whether they bring any beneﬁts in terms of cardiovascular\\ndisease prevention. As far as arterial hypertension is concerned, a prospective study by\\nRautiainen et al. [50] found no relationship between vitamin supplementation and the risk\\nof developing hypertension in healthy women. Wang et al. [51], who investigated obese\\nwomen with increased cardiovascular disease risk in a randomized study, reported that a\\n26-week supplementation with a vitamin–mineral preparation signiﬁcantly lowered blood\\npressure compared with the placebo given to the control group.'),\n",

The beneﬁts of potassium supplementation have been extensively docu-\\nmented. Experts believe that potassium supplementation in patients with hypertension\\nsupports treatment and may be recommended [53,54].\\nAs for other endpoints of studies on vitamins and minerals intake and cardiovascular\\ndiseases, Park et al. [55] conducted a study in over 180,000 people in the US and found\\nthat multivitamin preparations do not inversely correlate with cardiovascular mortality.\\nAdditionally, a randomized study in the US with more than 14,000 physicians reported\\nno positive effects of supplementation, either with single-preparation vitamin C, E, and\\nbeta-carotene or multivitamin preparation, with regard to cardiovascular incidents in either\\nhealthy subjects or individuals with cardiovascular disease [56]. Randomized trials also\\ndo not reveal the beneﬁts of B vitamins (folic acid, vitamins B6, and B12) supplementation\\nin patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease. Equally, in the study by Albert et al.\\nand Galan et al., no signiﬁcant effect on the risk of major cardiovascular events was\\nfound [57,58]. However, it should be mentioned that optimistic results were obtained in a\\nChinese study of taking enalapril (a drug for treating high blood pressure) in combination\\nwith folic acid. In this large randomized study, conducted among adults with hypertension\\nwithout a history of stroke or myocardial infarction, the combined use of enalapril and\\nfolic acid (0.8 mg/day), compared with enalapril alone, reduced the risk of the ﬁrst stroke\\nby 21% and the risk of composite cardiovascular events by 20% [59].\\nA meta-analysis of clinical trials and prospective cohort studies reported no relation-\\nship between vitamin–mineral supplementation and the incidence of stroke and the risk of\\ncardiovascular mortality in the general population [60]. An umbrella review of 2019 [61]\\nalso found no effect of vitamin preparations on the development of cardiovascular diseases\\nand cardiovascular mortality. For years, the US Preventive Services Task Force panel of\\nexperts has not been recommending vitamin–mineral supplementation for cardiovascular\\ndisease prevention in people without conﬁrmed insufﬁciency [62,63].\\n3.1.3. Antioxidants\\nAlthough no universal deﬁnition of antioxidants exists in the literature, it is believed\\nthat they are compounds that donate one of their electrons or hydrogen to free radicals,\\nstopping their chain reaction [64]. Some vitamins and minerals (vitamins A, C, E, beta-\\ncarotene, selenium, and zinc) are classiﬁed as antioxidants and are a subcategory of dietary\\nsupplements [65]. Antioxidants prevent the negative effects of free radicals, inhibit the\\noxidative process, and reduce inﬂammation in the body. The deﬁciency of these nutrients\\nin the body may increase the risk of developing a variety of conditions, including cardio-\\nvascular diseases [52,66]. Antioxidant supplementation has been extensively researched,\\nbut the ﬁndings remain inconclusive, especially in the case of vitamin E [13,67,68].\\nIn a study by Lee et al. [69], daily supplementation with 600 IU of vitamin E by\\nhealthy women for 10 years did not alter the incidence of myocardial infarction and\\nstroke as compared with the study’s control group taking placebos, but it did lower the\\nrisk of cardiovascular mortality by 24%. Lonn et al., [70] not only found that vitamin\\nE supplementation (400 IU/day for a median of 7 years) failed to reduce the risk of\\ncardiovascular incidence in affected individuals but also found that it increased the risk of\\nheart failure by 13%. The results of a recently published Mendelian randomization study\\nindicated that genetically conditioned higher blood concentrations of vitamin E elevated\\nthe concentrations of LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, decreased HDL concentration, and\\nincreased the risk of coronary artery disease [71].\\nThe results of several meta-analyses of randomized studies published over the years\\nalso remain inconclusive. In a 2003 meta-analysis of multiple studies, vitamin E (50–800 IU)\\nadministered for 1.4–12 years was shown to have no beneﬁcial effect on cardiovascular\\nmortality rates, and its routine use was not recommended [72].

Yet\\nanother meta-analysis from 2017 reported beneﬁcial effects of single-preparation vitamin\\nE—namely, a 12% reduction of the risk of cardiovascular mortality. However, the authors\\nfound no justiﬁcation for administration of other antioxidants, i.e., vitamin C, selenium,\\nand zinc [13]. The International Lipid Expert Panel believes that current research results\\ndo not show any beneﬁts of vitamin E supplementation in the prevention or treatment of\\nheart failure, and they draw a similar conclusion for vitamin C [40].\\nFindings regarding beta-carotene are less optimistic. According to a meta-analysis of\\nrandomized studies, beta-carotene at a dose of 15–50 mg for 1.4–12 years has led to a slight\\nbut statistically signiﬁcant increase in cardiovascular mortality [72]. The US Preventive\\nServices Task Force panel of experts also opposes the use of both beta-carotene and vitamin\\nE in cardiovascular disease prevention [74]. The most radical position on antioxidant\\nsupplementation has been taken by the authors of the “Enough is enough: Stop wasting\\nmoney on vitamin and mineral supplements”, who claim that a sufﬁcient number of studies\\nhave demonstrated the lack of beneﬁts of vitamin–mineral supplementation to warrant\\nceasing any further research on their effectiveness [75].\\nIn summary, based on the available literature, it seems safe to conclude that supple-\\nmentation with vitamin–mineral preparations whose intake exceeds the needs of the body\\nis not a recommended method of cardiovascular disease prevention.

Dietary Supplements and Malignancy\\n3.2.1. Cancer Prevention\\nAccording to the literature, the effects of vitamin and mineral consumption on the\\nrisk of developing cancer has a U-shaped distribution (the dose–response curve). Optimal\\nintake of these components (the range that corresponds with the base of the curve) is associ-\\nated with lower risk of the disease, whereas both insufﬁciency and excessive consumption\\nmay promote carcinogenesis [9,76].\\nIn light of the growing popularity of the so-called “Western diet”, it seems prudent to\\nask whether vitamin and mineral supplementation may in fact reduce the development of\\ncancer and whether it brings any additional beneﬁts in people with healthy diets. A ran-\\ndomized study of vitamin C (500 mg/day) and E (400 IU every other day) supplementation\\nand cancer incidence in men, by Gaziano et al., [77] found no differences between the\\nstudy group and the placebo control group; similarly, Lee et al. [69] demonstrated no\\nbeneﬁts of vitamin E supplementation (600 IU every other day) in women. The results of\\na multi-center Selenium and Vitamin E Cancer Prevention Trial are even less favorable,\\nﬁnding that vitamin E supplementation (400 IU/day) increased the risk of prostate cancer\\nby 17% [78]. Additionally, in a long-term prospective study by Park et al., no relationship\\nwas found between multivitamin supplementation and cancer development [55].\\nAll hope that health improvements derive from vitamin supplementation was aban-\\ndoned after the results of studies on beta-carotene were published. In fact, those studies\\nmay even be considered as an argument against supplementation. There is an accumulat-\\ning body of evidence that suggests that beta-carotene, a typical antioxidant, may in fact\\nexert a pro-oxidative effect in smokers [79]. CARET, one of the ﬁrst randomized trials\\nconducted in the 1980s, demonstrated that administration of 30 mg of beta-carotene and\\n25,000 UI of retinol per day for an average of 4 years resulted in a 28% increased risk of lung'),\n",

Another randomized study, conducted with male smokers\\nfrom Finland between 1985 and 1993, included a similar conclusion. Supplementation\\nwith beta-carotene at a dose of 20 mg/day for an average of 6 years increased the risk\\nof lung cancer by 16% [81], and further analysis showed that the increased risk did not\\ncorrelate with nicotine and tar contents in the cigarettes [82]. A Japanese study on vitamin\\nA intake in the diet also generated unfavorable results. Higher consumption of vitamin A\\nwas associated with a 26% greater risk of lung cancer [83]. Based on the meta-analyses of\\nhigh-quality randomized trials, it seems that antioxidant administration (vitamin A, C, E,\\nselenium, and zinc combined) in healthy individuals does not lower the risk of developing\\nlung cancer. Vitamin C supplementation increased the risk of malignancy in women by\\n84%, and similarly, vitamin A increased the risk in smokers and people with history of\\nasbestos exposure by 10% [84]. Studies have also shown that antioxidant supplementation\\nproduces no beneﬁts in the prevention of bladder [79] or colorectal cancers [85].\\nAccording to some experts, antioxidant supplementation in cancer prevention may\\nonly be beneﬁcial in healthy people with vitamin insufﬁciency. High doses of antioxidants\\nmay even be harmful to people in the subclinical phases of the disease [76,86]. Selenium is\\na good example of the thin line between beneﬁcial and detrimental doses when the relation-\\nship between antioxidant consumption and the risks of developing cancer are concerned.\\nIn people with low blood concentrations of selenium, its supplementation lowers cancer\\nrisk, but in individuals with high blood concentrations of selenium, supplementation\\nincreases the risk of developing lung cancer [87,88].\\nVitamin D supplementation has also caused a lot of interest in recent years in relation\\nto cancer prevention because of the vitamin’s anti-inﬂammatory and immunomodulatory\\nproperties and the presence of Vitamin D Receptor (VDR) in most human organs. However,\\nmeta-analysis of randomized controlled trials has not conﬁrmed that vitamin D intake\\nreduces the incidence of cancer [89–91].\\nSummarizing the current state of knowledge about vitamin and mineral supplementa-\\ntion in cancer prevention, it is important to emphasize that the expert panel of the World\\nCancer Research Fund opposes the use of such preparations [92], as does the American\\nCancer Society, which, in addition, has concluded that if, despite the absence of beneﬁts,\\none chooses to take vitamin–mineral supplements, doses exceeding 100% of the daily\\ndemand should not be used [76]. According to the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force\\npanel of experts, we lack sufﬁcient data to determine the role of vitamin preparations\\nin cancer prevention, except for beta-carotene and vitamin E, whose supplementation is\\nuniversally discouraged [74].\\n3.2.2. Cancer Therapy\\nSupplement use among cancer patients is common and typically unsupervised by a physi-\\ncian. Alternative medicine therapies, including “word-of-mouth” dietary supplement recom-\\nmendations, are believed to be safe and complementary to the therapeutic process [74,88].\\nA study by Mandecka et al. [66] demonstrated that over 46% of cancer patients used dietary\\nsupplements, mostly antioxidants, although the patients’ mean intake of vitamin A, C,\\nand E from food ranged between 200% and 300% of the daily requirements. According\\nto the literature, 64–81% of cancer patients take vitamins or minerals, and 26–77% use\\nmultivitamin preparations [93,94]. Presumably, three-quarters of the physicians are not\\naware of what the patients take of their own accord, following the rule “patient keeps\\nquiet, doctor asks no questions”. The case of shark cartilage is an interesting example of\\nthe difference between popular perception and proven efﬁcacy, as it was extremely popular\\nin the 1990s, although it was utterly ineffective as a dietary supplement allegedly helpful\\nin ﬁghting cancer [95].\\nVitamin C, due to its antioxidative action and positive effect on the immune system,\\nhas been immensely popular among cancer patients. However, randomized studies showed\\nno indication that supplementation may provide favorable results [96]. In the case of the'),\n",

According to Ambrosone et al. [99], antioxidant supplementation in breast\\ncancer patients undergoing chemotherapy lowered the chance of survival. The American\\nInstitute for Cancer Research warned that patients undergoing chemotherapy or radiation\\nshould not ingest high doses of vitamins and minerals [100]. Vitamin–mineral preparations\\nare necessary in cases of patient malnutrition. According to the European Society for Clin-\\nical Nutrition and Metabolism (ESPEN), cancer patients whose diet provides them with\\nless than 60% of the required caloric content over the course of at least 1 week, should use\\nvitamin–mineral supplements in adequate doses so that they avoid nutritional deﬁciencies.\\nHowever, supplementation should be prescribed and monitored by a physician [87,88].\\nImportantly, more than half of cancer patients declare they received no information what-\\nsoever regarding vitamin and mineral supplementation during therapy [101].\\nHerbal supplements, which are commonly perceived by patients as completely safe\\ndue to their natural origin, are particularly dangerous [102–104]. The risk is associated,\\namong others, with the higher content of active substances in the supplements than\\noccur in the natural herbal resources, which results from the use of concentrated extracts\\nand sometimes additional synthetic analogues [105,106]. Additionally, recent years have\\nwitnessed the appearance of numerous preparations that include plants that have never\\npreviously been used in Western medicine. Their mechanisms of action have not been\\nsufﬁciently investigated and described, while the labels usually fail to include information\\nabout the contraindications, which does not mean they do not exist. Herbal components,\\nespecially herbal mixes, may have a negative effect on the drug mechanisms of action, both\\nby accelerating excretion from the body or by producing dangerously high concentrations\\nin the blood [88,104].\\nThe abovementioned data indicate that reasonable supplementation, tailor-made for\\nthe cancer patient and supervised by a physician, may in fact bring benefits and constitute\\na vital element of the cancer treatment. Unsupervised self-administration of dietary sup-\\nplements may cause serious complications during cancer therapy.

J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 8897\\n13 of 24\\n3.3. Dietary Supplements and Weight Loss\\nThe number of people with excessive weight continues to rise, and ﬁghting obesity\\nhas become one of the greatest challenges of contemporary medicine. A person wishing to\\nlose weight needs to undertake several difﬁcult life-changes and practice them consistently\\n(diet, physical activity, addiction-free). Meanwhile dietary supplements are presented as\\na compelling alternative to traditional methods for combatting obesity. Wróbel-Harmas\\net al. [107] demonstrated that weight loss supplements are the most frequently sought di-\\netary supplements on the Internet, followed by preparations for muscle building and sexual\\npotency. In the US, more than 30% of people with overweight and obesity believe supple-\\nments to be an effective method for losing weight [108], while in Poland these supplements\\nare used by as many as 40–50% of young women, regardless of their weight [15].\\nWeight loss supplements are usually multi-ingredient preparations, with over 4000 in-\\ndividual substances used in the production process. The average weight loss supplement\\navailable in Western markets is estimated to include 10 different ingredients [109]. The\\nmore complex the recipe, the harder it is to determine its effects on the body. The most\\npopular ingredients include chromium and chitosan, as well as green tea, Garcinia cambogia,\\nand bitter orange (Citrus aurantium) extracts [15,16]. Over the years, no studies have shown\\nthat the use of either single- or multi-ingredient preparations of those substances promotes\\nweight reduction.\\nA 2013 meta-analysis of randomized studies found that chromium supplementation\\nresulted in only 0.5 kg additional weight reduction in subjects with overweight and obesity,\\nas compared with those taking a placebo [110], and a comparable result (mean: 0.75 kg)\\nwas achieved in a similar 2019 meta-analysis [111]. In addition, the literature indicates that\\nchromium supplementation may be associated with several side effects: emesis, nettle-\\nrash, and dizziness [112]. Claims about the beneﬁts of chitosan, which allegedly binds\\nto fats in the digestive tract and inhibits fat absorption, are also exaggerated [113,114].\\nA 2018 meta-analysis of randomized trials revealed that chitosan supplementation for\\napproximately 17 weeks led to a slight decrease in body weight (mean: 1 kg) [113], and a\\nsimilar result was found in a 2020 meta-analysis of similar studies, which reported a 0.89\\nkg greater weight loss than those taking a placebo [115]. The effectiveness of green tea\\nextract is also questionable. In light of some data, green tea extract consumed for 12 weeks\\ndid not reinforce the weight loss process [116]; in light of other data, consumption of the\\nextract for up to 14 weeks by obese people causes a greater decrease in body weight (by\\n1.8 kg) and BMI (by 0.65 kg/m2) than occurring in those taking a placebo [117]. At the\\nsame time, a growing number of studies have shown there is a signiﬁcant risk linked\\nwith green tea extract, and we discuss this in more detail in the Safety of Supplement\\nUse section of the manuscript. Garcinia cambogia, which is a tropical plant whose fruit\\nincludes large quantities of hydroxycitric acid, which inhibits appetite and suppresses\\nfatty acid synthesis, has also been advertised by celebrities as a magical aid to losing\\nweight [104,118,119]. The results of studies on the effectiveness of Garcinia cambogia in\\nthe weight loss process are far from satisfying. A meta-analysis of 2011 randomized\\ncontrols demonstrated poor-to-borderline statistically signiﬁcant effects on body weight\\nloss (−0.88 kg) as compared with those on the placebo and demonstrated no effect on\\nBMI. The authors pointed out the small sample size of the studies they analyzed and\\nthe fact that the studies were conducted over short periods of time [120]. Slightly better\\nslimming effects of Garcinia cambogia supplements were shown by a 2020 meta-analysis\\nof such studies, where taking such supplements for 8–12 weeks resulted in decreases in\\nbody weight by −1.34 kg, BMI by −0.99 kg/m2, percentage of fat mass by −0.42%, and\\nwaist circumference by −4.16 cm compared with the placebo group [121]. Overall, the\\neffectiveness of Garcinia cambogia is believed to be under-researched, and long-term use is\\nnot recommended. Additionally, the plant is supposedly hepatotoxic [114,122]. Similarly,\\nresults to those above are found in the literature on bitter orange (Citrus aurantium), showing\\nno conclusive proof of its effectiveness [107,122,123]. However, there are reports on its\\nserious side effects (hypertension, chest pain, and tachycardia), especially among subjects'),\n",

Recipients who are exposed\\nto the advertisements of such supplements should be aware that their alleged effectiveness\\nhas not been tested in clinical trials. Advertising slogans such as “excellent fat burner”\\nhave no grounds. Additionally, if there was a weight loss preparation that was proven to be\\neffective, it would have been registered as a “medicine” and not as a “foodstuff”. The two\\nkey issues are that these products do not help people lose weight and they have serious\\nside effects, which may be a threat to patient health. Therefore, consuming fat burners,\\nespecially those purchased online, has been compared by some authors to playing a game\\nof “Russian roulette” [125]. If, despite the lack of evidence, patients wish to attempt to\\nlose weight using dietary supplements, they should never purchase these products from\\nunauthorized buyers or increase the recommended dose or use several products at the same\\ntime in the hope that it would accelerate their weight loss.

J. Environ. Res. Public Health 2021, 18, 8897\\n15 of 24\\n3.4. Safety of Supplement Use\\nIn Europe and the US, no documentation of safety of use is required before the intro-\\nduction of a dietary supplement to the market, although each jurisdiction’s laws clearly\\nstate that producers are responsible for the safety of a product [124,126]. Some authors have\\nstated that they believe that supplements are released onto the market to be tested by the\\nend-users [127]. The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) may withdraw a product from\\nthe market only after it has been deemed unsafe [128,129]. Additionally, routine quality con-\\ntrols are not carried out to check the active substance content and label compliance [105,107],\\nand yet half of some studies’ respondents claim that dietary supplements are sufficiently\\nmonitored, in the same way that over-the-counter drugs are [107,130].\\nEvidence of the unfavorable effects of supplement use continues to accumulate. Ac-\\ncording to the National Estimates of Emergency Department Visits, the most frequent\\ncomplaints in the US concern herbal or complementary nutritional preparations, including\\nweight loss products (66% and 26% of all interventions, respectively) [131]. As far as weight\\nloss products are concerned, 13,000 complaints are registered annually, including 2000 hos-\\npitalizations [132]. The main side effects include cardiac symptoms (palpitations and\\nchest pains), and the same symptoms have been observed in relation to the use of muscle\\nbuilding and sexual potency supplements [131]. The literature emphasizes that long-term\\neffects of supplement use are difﬁcult to predict and will only be known after they have\\nbeen present on the market for some years [133]. The Ephedra sinica shrub is an interesting\\nexample of this issue, as it became a component of weight loss preparations in the early\\n1990s in the US and was withdrawn in 2004 due to the incidence of life-threatening cardiac\\nside effects [112]. However, the use of the Ephedra sinica plant in foods, and consequently\\nin dietary supplements, was not banned in the European Union until 2015 [134]. Ephedra\\nherbal supplements accounted for over half of the complaints about adverse reactions to\\nherbs lodged with the US National Estimates of Emergency Department Visits, yet these\\nproducts constituted only 1% of total herbal product sales in the US at the time [112]. In\\n2004, the FDA received over 18,000 complaints and ﬁnally ruled that the product should\\nbe withdrawn [114]. Sibutramine (active ingredient in medicines) is yet another example\\nof a substance used is weight loss preparations whose negative side effects were revealed\\nonly after people had been using it for some time. It was released on the market in the late\\n1990s as a component of an appetite-blocking drug but was withdrawn in 2010 due to a\\nsigniﬁcant risk of cardiovascular disorders [135].\\nSince being ofﬁcial banned, both sibutramine and Ephedra sinica have become popular,\\nillegal components of weight loss supplements. In China, signiﬁcant quantities of sibu-\\ntramine were detected in 27 out of 120 weight loss supplements [103]. Despite a number of\\ncomponents being listed on the label of one Chinese product, Meizitanc, when investigated\\nin Poland, sibutramine was the only substance in this weight loss [136]. There is also an\\nassociated problem of additional ingredients that are also dangerous being included with\\nthe banned substances. For instance, the number of reports on laxatives, antidepressant,\\nyohimbine, and even amphetamine and its derivatives being found in supplements con-\\ntinues to grow [105,106,127,137]. A US study revealed that 11 out of 21 supplements that\\ncontained the Acacia rigidula extract that were purchased on the Internet contained the iso-\\nmer of amphetamine [138]. In South Korea, substances that bore a structural resemblance\\nto amphetamine were found in 10 out of 110 weight loss supplements [139]. In Italy, 28%\\nof the supplements purchased online contained sibutramine or substances only permitted\\nin medicines or their analogs, which had not been tested for toxicology [135]. Apart from\\nweight loss supplements, preparations for muscle building and sexual potency have also\\nbeen found to be contaminated. International studies indicate that 12–58% of the supple-\\nments for physically active people contained substances that have previously been banned\\nby the World Anti-Doping Agency [140].\\nDespite legal requirements, labels of dietary supplements cannot be treated as a source\\nof reliable information about the products’ contents. In North America, where the brain\\nhealth supplement market is developing rapidly, 10 out of 12 products contained non-'),\n",

Overall, it is estimated that approximately 20% of the supplements contain at\\nleast one banned substance. Importantly, in view of the number of products available on\\nthe market, the published cases are merely the tip of the iceberg [105,106].\\nLack of reliable data on supplement safety, contamination, and adulteration are the\\nreasons why supplements may cause grave side effects. So far, most reports have focused\\non the green tea extract, which may have caused liver damage, including fatal damage, in\\nmore than 50 individuals. For example, Exolise—a weight loss supplement that contained\\ngreen tea extract—was withdrawn from the market in Spain and France in 2003 [112,129].\\nDexaprine was a multi-ingredient supplement with green tea extract that was withdrawn in\\n2014 in Holland, as even half a tablet resulted in emesis, anxiety, and tachycardia [106]. In\\nPoland, anaphylactic reactions were observed in the case of a multi-ingredient preparation\\nwith green tea extract known as Linea Detox [133]. Supplements that contain Garcinia\\ncambogia may also pose a threat to patient life. Two cases are Hydroxycut, which resulted\\nin liver damage, heart arrhythmia, and death [118,124,132]; and Thermatrim, which was\\nsuspected of causing toxic leukoencephalopathy [142]. Kratom is yet another example of a\\ndangerous dietary supplement for muscle building that was withdrawn in 2018 from the\\nUS market after it caused the death of a young man [128].\\nThe rapid increase in the availability of dietary supplements aimed at improving\\ncognitive function, including Alzheimer’s disease, is the reason for the FDA issuing an\\nofﬁcial statement in 2019 to inform the public that the agency did not investigate dietary\\nsupplements for safety and effectiveness and that these preparations may be dangerous,\\nineffective, and delay patients’ decisions to seek medical help [143]. In light of the fact that\\nthe disturbing reports we have identiﬁed above continue to surface, there is an urgent need\\nfor a radical change in the way supplements are introduced to the market [127,144,145],\\nespecially in changing perceptions of products from “safe until proven unsafe” to “unsafe\\nuntil proven safe” [128]. There is a consensus among the experts that supplements require\\ncontrolled tests to be performed by independent laboratories to check for active substance\\ncontent and possible adulteration [105–107].\\n4. Discussion\\nDue to persistent media messaging about poor eating habits and that the typical\\n“Western diet” is far from nutritional, many people are convinced that their daily diet\\ndoes not meet the recommended levels for vitamins and minerals. However, the scientiﬁc\\nliterature shows that taking vitamins and minerals without medical justiﬁcation does not\\nlower the risks of cardiovascular disease and cancer and that sometimes it can even have a\\nnegative effect. It should also be borne in mind that disease is inﬂuenced by many factors,\\nboth genetic and environmental, and a beneﬁcial change in one element of the diet may not\\nhave any overall effect. Popular positive expectations of supplements are also dampened\\nby the fact that they are more often used by people who already eat better, lead a healthier\\nlifestyle, are better educated, and have a greater health awareness [6,8,10]. Therefore,\\nin such cases where the person already has a better nutritional status, including a lack\\nof vitamin and mineral deﬁciencies, supplementation may not be of beneﬁt, and long-\\nterm consumption of excessive quantities of these nutrients may, in fact, have detrimental\\nside effects. The risk of such side effects increases when consumers take several dietary\\nsupplements at the same time (for example, “for immunity”, “for the heart”, or “for an\\nefﬁcient mind”), as they may contain the same vitamins and minerals as each other.\\nOn the other hand, the beneﬁcial effect of using certain nutrients (omega-3 fatty\\nacids) in the treatment of lipid disorders, as demonstrated in studies, undermines the\\nregistration of preparations intended for this purpose as dietary supplements. Dietary\\nsupplements, by their deﬁnition, serve to supplement the usual diet with nutrients or\\ncomponents with a physiological effect, and this group of preparations does not include\\nmedicinal products [1,2,146]. Due to one of the basic rules that the use of preparations\\nfor therapeutic purposes should be prescribed and under the supervision of a physician,'),\n",

Moreover, Polish\\npharmaceutical law clearly emphasizes that in the case of a product that meets the criteria\\nfor classiﬁcation both as a medicinal product and as a dietary supplement, the provisions of\\npharmaceutical legislation, rather than food regulations, should be applied [147]. Currently,\\nthe dose of active ingredients is an important criterion in the registration process of dietary\\nsupplements [148]. It is also worth remembering that labeling and advertising of dietary\\nsupplements can neither imply nor make claims about the product’s preventive and/or\\ntherapeutic properties, which is consistent with food law and the regulations governing\\nall foodstuffs [149]. Therefore, dietary supplement packaging may not contain informa-\\ntion such as “for cancer prevention” or “for reducing cholesterol”. However, although\\nsuch requirements have long been in food legislation, the practice of portraying dietary\\nsupplements as products that quickly alleviate the symptoms of numerous health con-\\nditions, both by labelling and advertising methods, is relatively common [143,150–152].\\nUnsurprisingly, the public often ﬁnds it difﬁcult to differentiate between supplements and\\ndrugs [5,12] and uses the former to treat various medical conditions [128,153,154]. Such\\npractices have been observed even in the US, where manufacturers are legally obligated to\\ninclude the information “This product is not intended to diagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any\\ndisease” [9,128] on labels, unlike in the European Union. According to various authors,\\nknowledge about supplements among some physicians and pharmacists also leaves much\\nto be desired [155,156]. It is worth mentioning here that in Poland, considering the popular\\nmisconception that dietary supplements are drugs, as of 1 January 2020, self-regulation of\\nTV broadcasting companies and supplement manufacturers [157] was introduced. The new\\nregulations have introduced several important changes for TV advertising, chief among\\nthem the rule that every advertisement is required to include the following statement on\\nscreen: “Dietary supplement; contains ingredients which support physiological functions of the\\nbody by supplementing a typical diet; has no medicinal properties.”\\nConsidering the impact of dietary supplements on people’s health, it is important to\\nremember that the results of short-term studies do not provide irrefutable data on their\\neffectiveness and that even long-term studies, where lifestyle factors change over time and\\ninﬂuence a person’s health, also pose a problem. When interpreting the results of research\\non intake of vitamin and mineral preparations, especially multivitamin–mineral supple-\\nments, it should also be remembered that there is a considerable degree of heterogeneity in\\nsupplement ingredients and amounts of nutrients because the composition of supplements\\nis not directly regulated by law. Therefore, individual preparations may signiﬁcantly differ\\nfrom each other in dose and composition of ingredients, thus affecting research results.\\nIn addition, it should be noted that administering vitamin and mineral supplements to\\nthe study group does not mean that the control group did not gain appropriate levels of\\nthese ingredients from their daily diets, and thus does not mean that the control group\\nwas at risk of hypovitaminosis. Therefore, identifying the potential beneﬁts of supplying\\nnutrients in addition to the body’s normal requirements is difﬁcult.\\nThe author of this paper is aware of the limitations and issues in the cited studies and\\nconsequently is aware that this is not a systematic review. Therefore, it cannot be ruled\\nout that some publications, possibly presenting different research results, may have been\\nomitted. However, the author has made every effort to include as many publications as\\npossible, including randomized controlled trials and meta-analyses, and to discuss the\\nindividual issues in the paper in a balanced way, bearing in mind the length of the paper.\\nBecause of the widely different categories of dietary supplements, the article does not\\naddress the health effects of all, e.g., probiotics or polyphenols; thus, the author does not\\npresent an exhaustive discussion of the health effects resulting from taking supplements.\\n5. Conclusions\\nIn the absence of clinical trials conducted by the manufacturers of dietary supplements\\nprior to their supplements being introduced to the market, being able to understand the\\nhealth effects of using such preparations is an important public health issue.

An of-\\nﬁcially shared and accepted deﬁnition of nutraceuticals is still missing, as nutraceuticals are mostly referred to as pharma-foods, a\\npowerful toolbox to be used beyond the diet but before the drugs to prevent and treat pathological conditions, such as in subjects\\nwho may not yet be eligible for conventional pharmaceutical therapy. Hence, it is of utmost importance to have a proper and\\nunequivocal deﬁnition of nutraceuticals and shared regulations. It also seems wise to assess the safety, mechanism of action and\\nefﬁcacy of nutraceuticals with clinical data.

This overlap becomes even\\nwider when we consider functional foods and nutraceuticals.\\nWhat could be considered a functional food under a given set\\nof circumstances may be named a dietary supplement,\\nmedical food, food for special dietary use or nutraceutical\\nunder different circumstances, depending on its ingredients\\n(active components) and the claims reported on its label [1].\\nWhile the deﬁnition of a food supplement is quite clear\\nand understandable (see Table 1), the deﬁnition of a\\nnutraceutical is still in the grey area between food, food\\nsupplements and pharmaceuticals. The term nutraceutical, a\\nsyncretic neologism of the words nutrient and pharmaceutical,\\nwas originally coined by Stephen DeFelice, who deﬁned\\nnutraceuticals as “food or part of a food that provides medical\\nor health beneﬁts, including the prevention and/or treat-\\nment of a disease” [2]. This concept has been proposed as\\na modern approach to food science, and the area of possi-\\nble use has been deﬁned as beyond the diet, but before the\\ndrugs [3, 4]. Notwithstanding this concept, the deﬁnition\\nof nutraceuticals and a legitimate assessment of their\\npotential in medicine are still contradictory and far from\\nbeing shared and accepted worldwide [5].\\nThe nutraceutical deﬁnition often overlaps with the\\naccepted deﬁnition of food supplements [6, 7], and the\\nrationale behind the use of these products is becoming\\nmore and more important in their distinction.\\nNutraceuticals are continuously developed and have\\nquickly spread worldwide [8]. Existing contradictory infor-\\nmation in the ﬁeld is generating confusion about the possible\\neffective use of these products, which are available on the\\nmarket and in pharmacies. Food supplements, as per their\\nmicronutrient content, can be used to improve the health\\nof individuals in need. In general, many of the health claims\\nthat are currently associated with food supplements, pro- and\\nprebiotics, herbal products, and functional foods may not\\nproperly be substantiated by scientiﬁc data on their safety,\\nefﬁcacy and effect on health and/or pathological conditions.\\nThe claims are mainly unsubstantiated due to a lack of\\nstudies on possible mechanisms of action and a lack of\\nin vivo research conﬁrming the claimed beneﬁcial health\\neffects on speciﬁc pathological conditions. Another key\\naspect is related to the data reported in the literature, which\\nmainly comes from in vitro studies focused on single food\\nconstituents (micronutrients); these studies are based on the\\nassumption that micronutrients can be considered safe (or\\ngenerally recognized as so) because they are derived from\\ncommonly used food or food components [8, 9]. Safety is of\\nutmost importance, as there is also the possibility of\\ncontaminants of inorganic and organic origins in these\\nproducts [10, 11]. Moreover, the ingredients themselves may\\ncause health problems, and proper information on possible\\nunwanted side effects should be provided on the label. From\\nour point of view, it is imperative to have more information\\non safety and efﬁcacy based on clinical studies rather than\\nonly in vitro studies, and it is also important to reach a better\\nunderstanding of the mechanism of action and bioavailabil-\\nity of these products. The ﬁrst step in assessing the action of\\nnutraceuticals is to distinguish them from the other food-\\nderived products, particularly food supplements, which are\\nnot always included in daily dietary habits in the presence of\\na speciﬁc need [12].\\nThis exercise may require: (i) appropriate target identiﬁca-\\ntion; (ii) safety assessment; (iii) a clear understanding of the\\nmechanism of action; (iv) efﬁcacy assessment substantiated\\nby clinical studies; (v) an evaluation of possible unwanted\\nside effects; and (vi) an evaluation of possible interactions\\nwith other products (e.g. food, food supplements and drugs).\\nWe think that a different approach for nutraceutical concept\\nassessment, use and deﬁnition is needed, and the existing\\nassessment methodology for pharmaceutical products may\\nbe considered as a starting point.\\nResolving\\nthe\\ndiscrepancies\\nbetween\\nthe\\ndifferent\\naccepted deﬁnitions of nutraceuticals and their regulatory\\naspects will be a signiﬁcant challenge. An outline of the lack\\nof shared regulations regarding nutraceuticals as pharma-\\nfoods is needed [13]; nutraceuticals are considered to be in\\nthe grey area after diet, but before drugs. Therefore, it is\\nimportant to clearly identify their speciﬁcity in view of their\\npossible use and utility in the pharmaceutical arena.\\nState of the art and future trends\\nThe ﬁrst step in food regulation in Europe was established in\\n1997 with the Green Paper on Food Law, and it was followed\\nby the White Paper on Food Safety in 2000, which outlined\\nthe need for new and improved legislation in the ﬁeld [14].\\nThese papers led to the General Food Law Regulation [Regula-\\ntion (EC) No. 178/2002 of the European Parliament and of\\nthe Council 2002], which established the principle and\\nforesaw the creation of an independent organization called\\nthe European Food Safety Authority (EFSA) with the speciﬁc\\ntask\\nof\\ngiving\\nscientiﬁc\\nadvice\\nbased\\nupon\\nscientiﬁc\\nassessment of the beneﬁcial health effects and associated risks\\nrelated to food intake [15].\\nThe\\nEFSA mission\\nalso includes\\nfood\\nsupplements,\\nwhereas the responsibility for risk management and commu-\\nnication was taken on by the European Commission and\\nParliament. The risk assessment and risk evaluation can also\\nbe included as a part of the EFSA mandate if it follows a\\nspeciﬁc request made by the European Commission and\\nParliament from a European Member State or stakeholder.\\nThis step should then be followed by speciﬁc action from\\nlocal national authorities, who take the suggestions on board\\nand propose appropriate legislation and regulation in the\\nﬁeld. The mission of the EFSA is to “provide the basis for the\\nassurance of a high level of protection of human health and\\nconsumer interest in relation to food, considering the\\ndiversity\\nin\\nthe\\nsupply\\nof\\nfood,\\nincluding\\ntraditional\\nproducts, while ensuring the effective functioning of the\\ninternal market. It establishes common principles and\\nresponsibilities, the means to provide a strong science base,\\nefﬁcient organizational arrangements and procedures to un-\\nderpin decision-making in matters of food and feed safety.”\\nThis statement applies to all foodstuffs, and these general\\nprinciples also cover foods with added functional properties\\n(e.g. functional foods, food supplements, herbal products,\\nA.

The European Council Regula-\\ntion (EC) No. 178/2002 deﬁnes food or foodstuff as “any sub-\\nstance or product, whether processed, partially processed or\\nunprocessed, intended to be, or reasonably expected to be\\ningested by humans” [15]. According to the abovementioned\\ndeﬁnition, medicinal products cannot be considered food,\\nand this seems to suggest that one possible tool to decide\\nwhether medicinal or food regulations apply to a speciﬁc\\nproduct may be identiﬁed in the medicinal regulation area.\\nNonetheless, food derivatives with speciﬁc beneﬁcial effects\\non health, such as functional foods and nutraceuticals, can\\nbe considered similar to medicinal products if their micronu-\\ntrient content is considered. Medicinal products are deﬁned\\nby Directive 2001/83/EC of the European Parliament, which\\nwas amended by Directive 2004/27/EC of the Council [16].\\nThis Directive, among others, addressed the requirements\\nand procedures for marketing authorization of medicinal\\nproducts for human use. Medicinal products are deﬁned as\\n“any substance or combination of substances presented as\\nhaving properties for treating or preventing disease in human\\nbeings, or any substance or combination of substances that\\nmay be used in or administered to human beings either with\\na view to restoring, correcting or modifying physiological\\nfunctions by exerting a pharmacological, immunological or\\nmetabolic action, or to making a medical diagnosis”.\\nSection 2.2 of Directive 2004/27/EC clariﬁes that “In cases\\nof doubt, where, taking into account all its characteristics, a\\nproduct may fall within the deﬁnition of a ‘medicinal\\nproduct’ and within the deﬁnition of a product covered by\\nother Community legislation, the provisions of this Directive\\nshall apply” [16].\\nIn our opinion, nutraceuticals require an appropriate\\ndescription and speciﬁc classiﬁcation. Nevertheless, while\\nnutraceuticals should always have speciﬁc added health value\\nfor the prevention or treatment of pathological conditions,\\nfood supplements may not be required to have this character-\\nistic. Notwithstanding the differences existing between them\\nthat were outlined previously, Article 2 of Directive 2002/46/\\nEC (Directive 2002/46/EC of the European Parliament and of\\nthe Council 2002) deﬁnes only food supplements as “food-\\nstuffs, the purpose of which is to supplement the normal diet\\nand which are concentrated sources of nutrients or other\\nsubstances with a nutritional or physiological effect, alone\\nor in combination, marketed in dose form, namely, forms\\nsuch as capsules, pastilles, tablets, pills and other similar\\nforms, sachets of powder, ampoules of liquids, drop dispens-\\ning bottles, and other similar forms of liquids and powders\\ndesigned to be taken in measured small unit quantities”,\\nwithout mentioning nutraceuticals [17].\\nFood supplements can contain substances with a physio-\\nlogical effect other than nutritional value and so can\\nnutraceuticals, according to our view. A product must be\\navailable in a concentrated form and should be taken in\\nthe proper pharmaceutical form to fall under Directive\\n2002/46/EC.\\nNutraceuticals can be marketed with same pharmaceuti-\\ncal form of food supplements. We instead propose a different\\nclassiﬁcation approach for these products to differentiate\\nthem from food supplements [17]. The current European\\nDirective 2002/46/EC on food supplements mainly focuses\\ninter alia on vitamins and minerals as supplements and\\nforesees that maximum amounts of vitamins and minerals\\nmust consider the upper safe levels established by scientiﬁc\\nrisk assessment considering different consumer groups and\\nthe intake of vitamins and minerals derived from other\\ndietary sources. For nutraceuticals, a different approach based\\non beneﬁcial health effects may be more appropriate consid-\\nering the pharmacological effect of these food derivatives.\\nPrior to 2002, food supplements were subjected to national\\nregulations, which set the legislation framework and risk\\nassessment management. Regarding food supplements, the\\nEuropean Responsible Nutrition Alliance (ERNA) suggested\\na risk management model for determining maximum risk\\nlevels for different nutrient intakes based on the population\\nsafety index in 2004 [18]. In 2006, ERNA contributed to the\\nestablishment of guidelines for nutrition and health claim\\nregulations,\\nsuggesting\\nthese\\nguidelines\\nas\\na\\ntool\\nfor\\ncompanies to provide correct communication about the\\nmany health beneﬁts of vitamins, minerals, omega 3 fatty-\\nacids etc. [19].\\nThe key aspect here is that food supplements and\\nnutraceuticals are both considered to be derived foodstuffs,\\nwhich means that, in many cases, the precautionary princi-\\nple valid for food is applied to food supplements, and the\\nterm nutraceutical is used for products available on the\\nmarket without proper assessment of their beneﬁcial health\\neffects, except in cases speciﬁcally provided in the food\\nTable 1\\n(Continued)\\nFood for medical use (EU, 1999)\\nComplete nutritional food with a formulation of\\nnutrients standards, which may constitute the sole\\nsource nutrition for the person to whom it is addressed.\\nOr alternatively: complete nutritional food with a\\nformulation of nutrient adapted to a speciﬁc disease,\\ndisorder or medical condition, which may constitute\\nthe only source of nutrition for the person to whom\\nit is addressed.

This arrangement does not\\ncompletely ﬁx the issue of borderline deﬁnitions and classi-\\nﬁcations between medicinal products, food supplements\\nand nutraceuticals [15].\\nIt would hence be advisable that the European Commis-\\nsion or authorities in charge explore the possibility of\\nincluding nutraceuticals in their Directives or Regulations\\nby deﬁning a new category that differentiates them from food\\nsupplements and pharmaceuticals. This area is hence not\\ncompletely regulated in Europe nor in the USA. In particular,\\nno effective, shared regulatory system exists in the USA\\nregarding medical or health claims for nutraceuticals, even\\nthough these products have entered mainstream science\\nand medicine and the consumer marketplace. This lack of\\nrules negatively inﬂuences the market for these products,\\ncan generate confusion among consumers, and eventually,\\ncan lead to possible misuse.\\nNutraceuticals that demonstrate speciﬁc pharmacological\\nactivities can claim beneﬁcial health effects for pathological\\nconditions, and if they are considered vegetal supplements\\n(in cases of vegetal origin), they can be covered by legislation\\nfor food supplements. This stipulation could, however, imply\\nthe need to obtain authorization for a health claim from EFSA\\nin Europe, as a cause–effect relationship must be substanti-\\nated by clinical data. An EFSA positive opinion would be nec-\\nessary to assess and recognize their potential use and hence\\nmarket the nutraceutical as a pharma-food, demonstrating\\nthe large difference that exists between nutraceuticals and\\nfood supplements. Regulation EC 1924/2006 on nutrition\\nand health claims made on food was issued to harmonize\\nthe laws and different legislations among Member States to\\nguarantee safety and efﬁcacy and to simultaneously protect\\nthe internal market by providing proper, understandable\\ninformation to consumers [20]. In accordance with this\\nRegulation, any health or nutritional claims on food must\\nbe approved from EFSA before marketing. Health claims are\\ngenerally related to nutritional proﬁles, the overall nutri-\\ntional composition of a foodstuff and the presence of nutri-\\nents that have been scientiﬁcally recognized as having a\\nbeneﬁcial effect on health. National regulations often apply\\nin the absence of speciﬁc shared international rules concer-\\nning recommendations or any endorsements by national\\nmedical associations. This scheme outlines the need for a\\nsupra national legal framework for claims and to provide\\ncorrect information to consumers. Nutraceuticals could be\\neffectively used to prevent and cure some illnesses, and\\nconsequently their correct use and proper information on\\nclaims substantiated by clinical data are of utmost impor-\\ntance. Nutraceuticals are generally reported to have good\\nsafety proﬁle with few unwanted side effects and high\\nbioavailability [21]. Their application area ranges from meta-\\nbolic syndrome and inﬂammation control to Alzheimer’s\\ndisease [4, 22–27].\\nIt must, however, be noted again that current European\\nlegislation\\ndoes\\nnot\\nmention\\nthe\\nterm\\nnutraceutical.\\nNutraceuticals could be considered within the Foods for\\nParticular Nutritional Uses (PARNUTS) regulatory framework\\n(Directive 89/398/EEC 1989), which includes foods for\\nspecial medical purposes and food intended for particular\\nnutritional needs, once their safety and efﬁcacy have been\\nproperly assessed by in vitro and in vivo studies [28].\\nThis aspect was ﬁrst outlined in 2002 when the Founda-\\ntion for Innovation in Medicine guided by Stephen DeFelice\\nlaunched the idea to establish a shared regulatory framework\\nfor nutraceuticals: the Nutraceutical Research and Education\\nAct, which envisioned the creation of a worldwide Nutraceu-\\ntical Commission speciﬁcally dedicated to the review and\\napproval\\nof\\nnutraceuticals\\nand\\nthe\\ndevelopment\\nof\\nprogrammes stimulating clinical research in this ﬁeld with\\nthe aim of substantiating all health claims with clinical\\ndata [29]. The realization of these actions and proper\\nworldwide availability of information could: (i) be beneﬁcial\\nfor individuals; (ii) be beneﬁcial for research in this area; (iii)\\nhelp lower the cost of pharmacological treatment for the\\nNational Health Systems by the adoption of prevention\\nmechanisms, including nutraceuticals in the daily diet\\nregimen; and (iv) realize a proactive approach towards\\npreventing, rather than curing, pathological conditions,\\nmany of which may arise from improper diet and lifestyle\\n(e.g. metabolic syndrome). The simplest proactive preventive\\napproach could be recognized by changing lifestyle and\\ndietary habits and increasing physical activity, which have\\nbeen suggested by all national health disease prevention\\nplans. This outcome is, however, not always easy to achieve\\nin populations and remains to be completed.\\nEfﬁcacy, together with safety, is to be considered of utmost\\nimportance for nutraceuticals. European Council Regulation\\n(EC) No. 178/2002 on food introduced a precautionary\\nprinciple in the risk management process in 2002. Risk\\nanalysis in authorization procedures and claims approval\\nmay also be relevant for nutraceuticals, food supplements\\nand functional foods [15].\\nWhen possible harmful health effects are identiﬁed, but\\nnot fully scientiﬁcally substantiated, the precautionary prin-\\nciple protects the rights of individuals, industry and organiza-\\ntions with the necessity of reducing the risk of affecting the\\nhealth of humans, the environment, plants and animals.\\nThe ﬁrst step of safety assessment was established in 1997\\nwith Regulation EC No. 258/97 of the European Parliament\\nand of the Council on novel foods and novel food ingredients\\nand was followed by European Council and Commission\\nRegulation EC No. 1852/2001 [30, 31].\\nBoth recognized the need to have a safety assessment\\nthrough a shared procedure before placing food supplement\\non the market. This procedure was demanded by the Member\\nStates and is still far from being completed. In November\\n2015, Regulation EU 2015/2283 of the European Parliament\\nand of the Council on novel foods revised the rules to deﬁne\\nand place novel foods on the market within the European\\nUnion, amending Regulation EU No. 1169/2011 of the\\nEuropean Parliament and of the Council [32].\\nNovel foods appear, as per their deﬁnition, in Article 3,\\nand are described as “food consisting of, isolated from or pro-\\nduced from plants or their parts, except when the food has a\\nhistory of safe food use within the Union and is consisting\\nof, isolated from or produced from a plant or a variety of the\\nsame species obtained by traditional propagating practices\\nwhich have been used for food production within the Union\\nbefore 15 May 1997, or nontraditional propagating practices\\nwhich have not been used for food production within the\\nUnion before 15 May 1997, where those practices do not give\\nrise to signiﬁcant changes in the composition or structure of\\nNutraceutical regulatory framework\\nBr J Clin Pharmacol (2018) 84 659–672\\n663'),\n",

Nutraceuticals are still not mentioned in the 2015 Reg-\\nulation, notwithstanding their potential medicinal use to\\nprevent/cure some pathological conditions.\\nIt may be feasible to apply current legislation for pharma-\\nceuticals regarding efﬁcacy, safety and health effect assess-\\nment to nutraceuticals with the same restrictions. Another\\npossible approach could be to start by reconsidering Directive\\n1999/21/EC, which deﬁnes processed or formulated products\\nthat are intended for the dietary management of individuals\\nwith disrupted metabolism, or in special physiological\\nconditions, and must be prescribed by a medical doctor and\\nused under their supervision as PARNUTS [33]. PARNUTS\\nlegislation could be adopted to draw a possible scheme for\\nnutraceutical\\nvalidation\\nwith\\nthe\\naim\\nof\\nclearly\\ndistinguishing them from food supplements and/or from\\nfunctional foods intended for particular nutritional or clini-\\ncal uses.\\nAccording to Directive 89/398/EEC, PARNUTS should\\nhave a special composition for their claimed nutritional/\\nmedical purposes and should be clearly different from food-\\nstuffs for dietary use [28]. These products should be addressed\\nto individuals who do not qualify for pharmacological\\ntreatment and who could beneﬁt from alternative treatment\\ngiven their proven efﬁcacy. In this case, the possible target\\npopulation could be quite wide considering the growing\\nimpact on health due to improper lifestyles, particularly\\nmetabolic syndrome, which includes different pathological\\nhealth conditions, such as hypertriglyceridaemia, hyperten-\\nsion, hypercholesterolaemia, type II diabetes and obesity\\n[34, 35].\\nThe need for a scientiﬁc rationale\\nThe proper starting point for nutraceutical concept assess-\\nment\\nshould\\nbegin\\nwith\\na\\nsharp\\ndistinction\\nbetween\\nnutraceuticals and food supplements and with the identiﬁca-\\ntion of an appropriate epidemiological target. Food supple-\\nments have been already deﬁned as previously reported.\\nRegarding\\nnutraceuticals,\\nwe\\npropose\\nthe\\nfollowing\\ndeﬁnition: (i) for food of vegetal origin, a nutraceutical is\\nthe phytocomplex; and (ii) for food of animal origin, a nutra-\\nceutical is the pool of secondary metabolites. Both are\\nconcentrated and administered in the proper pharmaceutical\\nform. They are capable of providing beneﬁcial health effects,\\nincluding the prevention and/or the treatment of a disease.\\nTable 1 collects some of the most common deﬁnitions of\\nthese products together with other food-derived products.\\nMany of them belong to the food supplement category,\\nwhich also includes herbal products; these food supple-\\nments are often miscategorized with nutraceuticals. All of\\nthese productions, including pre- and probiotics, functional\\nfoods, and herbal supplements, claim beneﬁcial effects on\\nhuman health.\\nFood supplements are often confused with functional\\nfood, which, as per their deﬁnition, are food-derived prod-\\nucts (or food with the addition of one or more active com-\\npounds) that are included as part of a normal diet with the\\naim of obtaining beneﬁcial health effects. These supple-\\nments and functional foods can compensate and/or can\\nhave a beneﬁcial effect due to the addition of speciﬁc\\ncomponents if there is a lack of one micro- or macronutrient\\nin the body. They may not have any proven pharmacologi-\\ncal effect [36].\\nProbiotics and prebiotics are live bacteria generally used\\nto help gastrointestinal conditions and specialized plant\\nﬁbres that nourish the good bacteria already present in the\\nlarge bowel or colon (gut microbiota), respectively. Neither\\nhas a speciﬁc effect on pathological health conditions, but\\nthey can both be effective in helping good bacteria grow\\n[3]. It can be observed that this deﬁnition partially overlaps\\nwith the food supplement deﬁnition, creating confusing\\ninformation.\\nMedicinal products are well-deﬁned for speciﬁc indica-\\ntions. They must follow speciﬁc legislation on efﬁcacy, safety,\\nproduction and use in therapy to be authorized\\nand\\nmarketed. The dose and mechanism of action must be\\nidentiﬁed in detail, as must possible undesired side effects\\nand pharmacokinetics depending on the dose and on the\\nmethod of administration. Each step is clearly designed and\\naddressed before a new drug can be considered for the market.\\nOnce a medicinal product is placed on the market, its\\nbeneﬁt/risk ratio continues to be assessed throughout its\\nentire lifespan.\\nThe question is, why do nutraceuticals not follow a\\nsimilar procedure for assessing their safety, mechanism of\\naction and efﬁcacy before and after they are marketed?\\nNutraceuticals contain many active substances extracted\\nfrom a vegetal matrix (as a phytocomplex) or from animal\\norigin that are concentrated and administered in suitable\\npharmaceutical form, and as per their deﬁnition, they must\\nhave a proven pharmacological effect and rationale to be used\\nin a pathological condition (in addition to their nutritional\\nvalue), unlike food supplements and other food-derived\\nsubstances, including herbal derivatives.\\nThe adoption of nutraceuticals in daily diets may help\\nprevent the onset of pathological conditions by possibly\\ndelaying or avoiding the need to use pharmaceuticals in\\nsubjects who qualify for an alternative, nonpharmacological\\napproach to a health condition.\\nThe starting point for identifying and testing a nutraceu-\\ntical should be making a proper therapeutic hypothesis, such\\nas hypothesis that is coherent and supportable in the modu-\\nlation of a target capable of producing a beneﬁcial health\\nA.

The ﬁrst step of utmost\\nimportance is the identiﬁcation of the heath condition to\\naddress, followed by an assessment of safety and efﬁcacy with\\nclinical trials and a complete and accurate study/assessment\\nof the mechanism of action. The absence of unwanted side\\neffects and efﬁcacy are crucial steps prior to submitting an\\napplication to EFSA in Europe (or to the equivalent authority\\nin other countries) for a health claim to be authorized and\\nadvertised on the product label before advertising the prod-\\nuct or putting it on the market.\\nThe\\nnutritional\\nclaims\\npermitted\\naccording\\nto\\nthe\\nEuropean legislation for food are deﬁned and listed in the\\nAnnex of Regulation (EC) No. 1924/2006, which was\\nultimately amended\\nby European Regulation (EU) No.\\n1047/2012.

Any\\nclaim authorization is strongly conditioned by the availabil-\\nity of clinical data in order substantiate its efﬁcacy. In a simi-\\nlar way, the Dietary Supplement Health and Education Act\\n(DSHEA, 1994) deﬁned dietary supplements as a category of\\nfood, as did the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA),\\nwhich regulates dietary supplements with updates according\\nto the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act (FD&C Act, 2014) per\\nSection 413 (d) of the FD&C Act, 21 U.S.C. 350b (d) [42, 43].\\nRegulatory rules in different countries\\nThe milestone for assessing the safety and use of food was set\\nby the United Nations Food and Agricultural Organization\\n(FAO) and the World Health Organization (WHO) in the\\nCodex Alimentarius (FAO/WHO 1992). This collection of docu-\\nments contains general internationally recognized guidelines\\nthat establish rules for producing and marketing foodstuffs\\nand their derivatives. Many countries use these guidelines,\\nwhich deﬁne health claims in terms of: (i) nutrient function;\\n(ii) enhanced function; and (iii) reduction of risk [44, 45].\\nSpeciﬁcally, the nutrient function claim, which is deﬁned\\nas “the claim that describes the physiological role of the nu-\\ntrient in growth, development, and the normal function of\\nthe body”, does not explicitly refer to beneﬁcial health effects\\nof a nutrient or of a combination of micronutrients [44]. It\\ncan be observed that nutraceutical (e.g. phytocomplexes)\\nand food supplement (e.g. combinations of micronutrients)\\nregulatory systems seem to evolve very slowly compared to\\nthe growing number of products that are available on the\\nmarket worldwide.\\nIn the USA, the FDA, which focuses on safety aspects and\\nfood supplements, acknowledges the term nutraceutical and\\napplies a different set of regulations to them than those of\\nconventional foods and drugs. As per the Dietary Supplement\\nHealth and Education Act established in 1994 (DSHEA), it is\\nthe manufacturer’s responsibility to ensure that a nutraceuti-\\ncal is safe before it is marketed. The Food and Drug Adminis-\\ntration Modernization Act of 1997 contains sections that\\nenable health claims and nutrient content claims on food la-\\nbelling to be authorized based on an authoritative statement\\nfrom the Academy of Sciences or other federal authorities\\nafter notifying the FDA at least four months before the\\nintroduction of the supplement on the market [42].\\nWhile the FDA is authorized to act against any unsafe\\nproduct on the market, the EFSA does not have the same\\nmandate. EFSA must authorize/approve in detail any health\\nclaim before it is considered at a national or European level\\nprior to being put on the market following a speciﬁc request\\nfrom Member States, European Parliament or stakeholders.\\nFollowing the EFSA opinion, each State can decide indepen-\\ndently to set speciﬁc approval regulations and/or authoriza-\\ntion.\\nIn\\nthe\\nUSA,\\nhowever,\\nmanufacturers\\nand\\nother\\nstakeholders do not have to register their products with the\\nFDA because there is no need to obtain FDA approval and/or\\nauthorization before producing or selling food supplements\\nor nutraceuticals. Surveillance activity is relegated to govern-\\nmental agencies, and manufacturers are responsible for\\nensuring that information reported on the product label is\\ntrue and not misleading [46]. In Canada, nutraceuticals are\\nregulated more like a drug than as a food category [47].\\nOther countries have speciﬁc legislation; for example In-\\ndian legislation does not ascribe any speciﬁc legal status to\\nnutraceuticals. The government of India established the Food\\nSafety and Standards Act (FSSA) in 2006 to introduce a\\nlegislation system. FSSA does not separate functional foods,\\nnutraceuticals, and dietary supplements; instead, each is\\nindicated as food for a special dietary application. It considers\\nproducts with beneﬁcial health claims to be similar to food\\nwithout any statements about nutraceuticals with clinical\\ntrial results. In 2015, India notiﬁed the World Trade Organi-\\nzation of a draft regulation for nutraceuticals and foods for\\nspecial diets and medical purposes. The draft regulation\\ndeﬁned these categories based on ingredients, labelling,\\nadditives, contaminants, and health and nutritional claims.\\nThe draft regulation also determined the criteria for the\\nmanufacturing and sale of these categories of foods and\\nrecommended\\ndoses\\nor\\nconsumption\\nlevels.\\nThe\\nnew\\nregulation, namely, Food Safety and Standards for Food for\\nHealth Supplements, Nutraceuticals, Food for Special Dietary\\nUse, Food for Special Medical Purposes, Functional Food and\\nNormal Food Regulations 2016, is based on and framed from\\nSection 22 of the FSSA. The full text of the Regulation can\\nbe accessed from the FSSA website (http://www.fssai.gov.in/),\\nand the Food Safety and Standard Act No. 34 2006 can be\\naccessed from the FSSA web portal (http://www.fssai.gov.in/\\nportals/0/pdf/food-act.pdf).\\nJapan, by contrast, was among the ﬁrst countries to face\\nthe issue of regulating food supplements and foodstuff by is-\\nsuing the Foods for Speciﬁed Health Use (FOSHU) based on\\na voluntary request from stakeholders for approval [48, 49].\\nThis legislation, originally set in 1991, evolved into the\\n2003 Health Promotion Law [50].\\nPossible approval is available for food with beneﬁcial\\nhealth activities even if these activities are not substantiated\\nwith scientiﬁc evidence if the product meets the level of\\nFOSHU requirements (safety, nutritionally appropriate ingre-\\ndient content, etc.). Even food without an assessed and\\ndeﬁned mechanism of effectiveness for its function, namely,\\nqualiﬁed FOSHU and standardized FOSHU, can be consid-\\nered. Any reduction of disease risk claim is allowed if the\\nreduction of disease risk is clinically and nutritionally\\nestablished in one ingredient.\\nIn general, many countries, such as Australia or China,\\nregulate nutraceuticals simply as a category of food, and the\\nnational regulations valid for food apply [51–54]. A simple\\nregistration-based approach has been adopted by some\\ncountries, such as Colombia, Brazil and Argentina [55]. A\\nnotiﬁcation-based approach addressed to the local compe-\\ntent authority is valid in Mexico and Chile. Nevertheless,\\nother countries, such as Brazil, China and Taiwan, have\\nstricter requirements, and prior to registration, a complete\\nanimal or human clinical study is required [46].

This aim has led to the use of red\\nyeast rice (RYR). RYR is a food obtained from fermentation\\nwith the red yeast of Monascus purpureus, and the content of\\nits bioactive component monacolin K allowed it to be used\\nfor people with moderate dyslipidaemia.\\nMonacolin K (chemically identical to lovastatin, a drug\\nused to control hypercholesterolaemia), which has been\\nrecognized as a key component in cholesterol reduction,\\nhas been validated as the source of its hypocholesterolaemic\\neffect. A recent study on the safety proﬁle of RYR conducted\\nwithin the Italian Surveillance System of Natural Health\\nProducts\\non\\npossible\\nunwanted\\nside\\neffects\\ndue\\nto\\nconsumption observed cases of myalgia and/or an increase\\nin creatine phosphokinase, liver injury and gastrointesti-\\nnal reactions, and, in some cases, hospitalization [56].\\nThe potential outcomes of myopathies and liver injury\\nraise the hypothesis that the safety proﬁle of RYR is similar\\nto that of statins [57, 58]. For this reason, accurate monitor-\\ning of RYR and other food constituents should be promoted\\nto fully characterize their risk proﬁle, thereby helping regula-\\ntory bodies take appropriate actions.\\nAnother risk factor is represented by the possible presence\\nof secondary toxic metabolites, such as the mycotoxin\\ncitrinin, whereas the variable statin content in different red\\nyeast rice-based food supplements generated a controversial\\nscenario in which dose inconsistency and co-occurrence of\\nthe toxin citrinin resulted in criticism of its dietary supple-\\nmentation use [59].\\nCitrinin frequently contaminates foodstuff as do other\\nsecondary metabolites produced by microfungi present in,\\nfor example, milk [60]. Exposure to citrinin, produced by\\nmicrofungi of the Monascus species (Monascus purpureus\\nand Monascus ruber) and Penicillium species (Penicillium\\ncitrinum, Penicillium expansum, Penicillium radicicola and\\nPenicillium verrucosum), can cause nephrotoxicity and a\\nstrong oxidative stress [61]. The maximum level of this\\ncontaminant has been determined by Regulation EU No.\\n519/2014 of the European Commission in March 2014,\\nwhich set the maximum acceptable level of citrinin as\\n2000 μg kg–1 in RYR food supplements [62].\\nThe analysis of citrinin in RYR as a dietary supplement\\nand\\ntraditional\\nmedicine\\ncarried\\nout\\nusing\\na\\ncitrinin\\nimmuno-afﬁnity column for sample clean-up before LC anal-\\nysis with ﬂuorescence detection enabled analysis of citrinin\\nwith high degree of accuracy (limit of quantitation for citri-\\nnin in red yeast rice was 10 μg kg–1, and limit of detection\\nwas 3 μg kg–1), which conﬁrmed the presence of this contam-\\ninant in trace amounts [63].\\nA recent systematic analysis of 10 randomized controlled\\ntrials involving 905 Chinese subjects with dyslipidaemia\\ncompared the use of RYR (monacolin K) and simvastatin.\\nThe results conﬁrmed that they have similar effects on ele-\\nvated lipid levels, suggesting that the use of RYR as an alterna-\\ntive to simvastatin is not supported by current evidence,\\nexcluding patients intolerant to statins [64].\\nThe German Federal Institute for Drugs and Medical\\nDevices warned about the use of RYR, and the food safety\\nEuropean regulation requirements for food supplements con-\\ntaining active compounds established that the monacolin K\\ncontent should be considered a drug at levels higher than\\n5 mg day–1 due to existing scientiﬁc data supporting a phar-\\nmacological effect at this dose [65]. This regulation differs\\nfrom the EFSA 2011 opinion in which the limit of monacolin\\nK from RYR was set at 10 mg day–1 for the maintenance of\\nnormal blood levels of low density lipoprotein cholesterol\\nconcentration [66].\\nThis value has, however, been considered acceptable in\\nmany European countries even though it has been observed\\nthat lovastatin (monacolin K) can cause undesired side\\neffects, e.g. kidney problems or muscle issues; thus, RYR\\nproducts can also cause the same health issues, depending\\non the dose and considering the higher bioavailability of\\nred yeast rice-based food supplements, as pure lovastatin\\n[67]. Recently, the Conseil Superior de la Sante of Belgium\\nadvised that the exact amount of monacolin K in RYR is\\nhighly variable, ranging from 3 to 30 mg daily depending\\non the brand, representing a health risk due to the lack of\\nappropriate information to its users [68].\\nBy contrast, the US FDA issued a warning on these RYR\\nproducts in 2007. According to this warning, the content of\\nmonacolin K should be considered a drug at levels higher\\nthan 5 mg day–1 due to existing scientiﬁc data that support\\na pharmacological effect at this dose, as recently also con-\\nﬁrmed by the German expert panel of the Bundesamt für\\nVerbraucherschutz und Lebensmittelsicherheit (BVL) und\\ndas Bundesinstitut für Arzneimittel und Medizinprodukte\\n(BfArM) [65]. This report conﬁrms the opinion of the Autorité\\nfrançaise\\nde\\nSécurité\\nsanitaire\\nde\\nl’Alimentation,\\nde\\nl’Environnement et du Travail, which seems to suggest that\\nhigh values of monacolin K in RYR products should be\\nconsidered with caution due to possible monacolin K content\\nvariability\\n[69].\\nThe\\npossible\\ncontamination\\nfrom\\nco-\\noccurrence of the toxic metabolite citrinin generates an addi-\\ntional disputable scenario in which dose inconsistency and\\nsafety issues suggest caution against the use and need for\\nshared regulation assessment to guarantee safety, content\\nand dose-related efﬁcacy.

The term “nutraceutical” is not defined by U.S. law, but is generally \\nunderstood to be a purified product derived from a human food source, which is purported to \\nprovide extra health benefits beyond the basic nutritional value found in foods.\\nThe Food and Drug Administration (FDA) regulates dietary supplements in a markedly \\ndifferent way than regular drugs. A manufacturer of a drug needs to document its \\neffectiveness and safety before it can be brought to the market. There is no requirement for \\ndemonstrating the efficacy of a dietary supplement for any health condition. Manufacturers \\nof dietary supplements are not allowed to claim that the supplement can be used for treating \\nor preventing any particular disease. However, statements pertaining to general well-being, \\nfunction and health can be allowed provided a disclaimer is listed on the product with the \\ntext: “This statement has not been evaluated by the FDA. This product is not intended to \\ndiagnose, treat, cure, or prevent any disease” (2). The requirements for safety of dietary \\nsupplements are much less stringent than for a drug. No clinical trials are required. \\nIngredients sold in the US before October 15, 1994 do not need safety evaluation by the \\nFDA, as they are generally recognized as safe based on their historical use. For a new dietary \\ningredient not sold before October 15, 1994, the manufacturer must notify the FDA and \\nprovide reasonable evidence that it is safe for human consumption (2).\\nDietary supplements are widely used. Half of adults in the US report having used at least \\none supplement in the past 30 days (3). The most cited reasons for taking the supplements \\nwere to improve overall health, maintain health, and, especially among women, for bone \\nhealth. The most commonly used supplements were multivitamin/mineral supplements, \\ncalcium supplements, and omega-3/fish oil (3). About a quarter of the supplements were \\nused based on advice by health care providers. Thus, most decisions to use supplements are \\nmade by the consumers themselves.\\nDespite their popularity, the health benefits of dietary supplements are questionable. Lack of \\nvitamins will certainly cause deficiency diseases such as scurvy, beriberi, pellagra, and \\nrickets. However, the vitamin content of normal well-balanced diets is sufficient to avoid \\nthese diseases. Studies aimed at determining effects of supplements often give conflicting \\nresults. There currently doesn’t seem to be any scientific consensus on whether vitamins (4) \\nor any other dietary supplements prevent disease or have health benefits in well-nourished \\nindividuals.\\nThe intake of dietary supplements is generally safe, but not totally without risk. The current \\nreview is not intended to be comprehensive report of all known adverse effect for all dietary \\nsupplements. Instead, we have selected to discuss adverse events for the most commonly \\nused supplements such as vitamins, minerals, omega-3/fish oil, soy protein, and plant-\\nderived antioxidant and anti-inflammatory nutraceuticals. We also discuss weight-loss and \\nbody building supplements, and various botanical supplements which have been associated \\nwith more severe adverse effects.\\nSince dietary supplements can be brought to the market without the support of clinical trials, \\nthere is a paucity of systematic studies of adverse effects.

However, it is close to impossible to show causation \\nfrom a single case report. The link can be strengthened if symptoms disappear with cessation \\nof intake and reappear if the supplement is ingested again. Otherwise, an accumulation of \\ncases over time or the appearance of a cluster of cases can ultimately establish that intake of \\na supplement can result in adverse effects.\\nVITAMIN AND MINERAL SUPPLEMENTS\\nBy the early 20th century, it had become clear that nutrition consisting solely of \\ncarbohydrates, fats, and proteins is insufficient for maintaining health. The term “vitamine” \\nwas coined by Casimir Funk in 1912 to describe the micronutrients whose deficiencies cause \\nberiberi, scurvy, and pellagra (5). As the various vitamins were isolated and synthesized, a \\nmarket for vitamins quickly developed. Today, multivitamin/multimineral, vitamin and \\nmineral supplements are the most widely utilized dietary supplements by the American \\npopulation (3,6). It has been reported that 33% of US adults use multivitamin and/or \\nmultimineral supplements (7) and that this is as high as 32–47% among male military \\npersonnel and 40–63% among military women (8). Among long term cancer survivors, use \\nof vitamin or mineral supplements is even higher at 64–81% (7). Although adequate intake \\nof these micronutrients is required to maintain optimal health, the possibility of toxicity \\nincreases with increasing dose (9). Since dietary micronutrient deficiency is increasingly \\nrare in developed counties, most supplement consumers actually have excess vitamin and \\nmineral intake. Despite widespread belief that vitamin and mineral supplements are health \\nbeneficial, recent reviews of vitamin and mineral supplement trials in community-dwelling \\nadults with no nutritional deficiencies have concluded that there is no clear evidence of \\nbeneficial health effects. These include primary or secondary prevention of chronic diseases \\nincluding cardiovascular disease, cancer, cognitive decline and effects on overall mortality \\n(10,11). Indeed, on the contrary, there is evidence for possible harm based on consumption \\nof individual vitamins and mineral in excess. Toxicity following consumption of water-\\nsoluble vitamins is rare. However, photosensitivity and neurotoxicity have been reported at \\ndoses higher than 500 mg/d of pyridoxine (vitamin B6) (12) and cases of pyridoxine-\\nassociated chronic sensory polyneuropathy have been reported in elderly patients consuming \\nmultivitamin supplements (13). Reports of toxicity associated with overconsumption of \\nsupplemental antioxidant fat-soluble vitamins are more prevalent. Vitamin E is a family of 8 \\nrelated tocopherols and tocotrienols of which α-tocopherol is the form generally used in \\nsupplements. Doses of 800–1200 mg/d can result in bleeding associated with antiplatelet \\naction and doses above 1200 mg/d can result in diarrhea, weakness, blurred vision and \\ngonadal dysfunction (12). Moreover, vitamin E supplementation following radiation therapy \\nin a randomized trial of head and neck cancer patients was associated with increased cancer \\nrecurrence in the first 3.5 years of follow-up (14) and meta-analysis has suggested an \\nincrease in all-cause mortality after high dose vitamin E supplementation (15). Toxicity has \\nalso been associated with consumption of supplemental vitamin A and its provitamin \\ncarotenoid precursors. In two large clinical trials, the Retinol Efficacy Trial (16) and the \\nATBC study (17), male smokers receiving β-carotene supplements had significantly \\nincreased risk of lung cancer. The ABTC study further showed that prostate cancer incidence \\nand mortality were increased in male alcohol users consuming the supplement. An \\nRonis et al.\\nPage 3\\nAnnu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol.

Excess vitamin A supplementation has been suggested to be associated \\nwith adverse effects on bone health including low bone mineral density and increased \\nfracture risk (20). In addition, women consuming large amounts of vitamin A supplements \\nduring pregnancy have been reported to have increased incidence of congenital \\nabnormalities (21). There is also a case report of intra-hepatic cholestasis in a patient with \\nchronic hypervitaminosis A after 12 years of supplement consumption which resolved after \\nsupplements were ceased (22). In addition to toxicity from excess vitamin consumption, \\ntoxicity can arise from excess consumption of minerals. In particular, there is an increasing \\nrisk of hyperchromatosis, an iron storage disease associated with liver injury after excess \\nconsumption of iron or multimineral supplements (23,24). This can be exacerbated by \\nalcohol consumption (24).\\nFISH OIL AND OMEGA-3 FATTY ACIDS\\nOmega-3 fatty acids are essential fatty acids that cannot be synthesized de novo in humans \\nand therefore must be provided through the diet (25). A link between fish oil and ischemic \\nheart disease was suggested by a widely-publicized study from 1971 of Eskimos \\n(Greenlanders) from the west coast of Greenland (26). Greenlanders eating a traditional \\nmeat and fish diet that is rich in polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids had significantly lower \\nlevels of plasma total lipids, plasma cholesterol, plasma triglycerides and pre-β-lipoprotein \\n(= very low density lipoprotein) than both Danes and Greenlanders living in Denmark. The \\nauthors hypothesized that this diet contributed to the low incidence of ischemic heart disease \\nand diabetes among Greenlanders. Since then, polyunsaturated omega-3 fatty acids taken in \\nthe form of fish oils, krill oil or mixtures of docosahexaenoic and eicosapentaenoic acids \\n(DHA and EPA) purified from fish oils have become widely utilized dietary supplements. \\nThese fatty acids have metabolites with anti-inflammatory properties and have electrical \\nstabilizing effects on ion channels in cardiac myocytes (27,28). They have been linked to \\nanti-cancer and cardioprotective effects (29,30). However, the therapeutic benefits on \\ncardiovascular diseases are still controversial due to disparate findings from different clinical \\ntrials (31).\\nIt appears that fish oil and omega-3 fatty acids are well tolerated even at doses of 1–2,000 \\nmg/d and there is little evidence of toxicity. However, simultaneous consumption of fish \\nliver oils which also contain vitamin A and multivitamin supplements could result in \\nhypervitaminosis A. Furthermore, fish oils and omega-3 fatty acid supplements may \\nexacerbate anticoagulation and promote bleeding in patients taking anticoagulant \\nmedications such as warfarin (32,33).\\nPROTEIN POWDERS AND INFANT FORMULA\\nProtein powders consisting of the dairy proteins casein, whey and of vegetable proteins in \\nsoy protein isolate (SPI) are popular supplements among athletes and body builders. These \\nproteins are also the basis of infant formulas fed to over 4 million U.S. infants each year. \\nThe dairy proteins appear to have little toxicity except in individuals with allergies to cow’s \\nmilk protein, although excessive consumption may result in ketosis.

Epigenome-wide DNA methylation \\nanalysis of vaginal cells from cow- and soy-infant formula fed girls indicated differential \\nDNA methylation associated with decreased expression of the estrogen-responsive proline \\nrich 5-like (PRR5L) gene (38). In addition, epidemiological studies have suggested a slightly \\nearlier age of menarche (12.4 vs. 12.8 years) but less female-typical play in soy formula-fed \\ngirls (39,40). In contrast, data from a longitudinal ultrasound study of breast, cow’s milk \\nformula and soy-formula-fed infants (The Beginnings Study) demonstrated no significant \\neffects on testis or prostate volumes or structural characteristics at ages 1 year and 5 years \\n(41,42). In addition, a retrospective cross-sectional study of adults fed soy formula or cow-\\nmilk formula as infants did not find significant differences in responses to questions about \\nhealth and reproduction (43). Moreover, in adult men, a recent meta-analysis showed no \\nsignificant effects of soy protein on male reproductive hormones (44). Animal studies of SPI \\nand soy formula toxicity have likewise been contradictory. Akingbemi et al. (45) reported \\nthat perinatal exposure to diets made with soy resulted in suppressed steroidogenesis, \\ndecreased testosterone secretion and increased Leydig cell proliferation in rats. Similarly, \\nSharpe et al. (46,47) reported that marmoset monkeys fed soy infant formula had suppressed \\nserum testosterone concentrations. Increased testis size, and Leydig cell numbers/testis were \\nalso observed in these monkeys at adulthood consistent with compensated Leydig cell \\nfailure. In adult female ovariectomized mice, feeding SPI was shown to increase growth of \\nhuman breast cancer cell xenografts consistent with an estrogenic effect (48). These studies, \\nand concerns regarding estrogenicity, led to a recent review of the safety of soy infant \\nformula by a panel from the Center for the Evaluation of Risks to Human Reproduction \\n(CERHR) established by the National Toxicology Program (NTP) and the National Institute \\nfor Environmental Health Sciences (NIEHS). However, the committee was unable to issue a \\nconclusive recommendation regarding developmental and reproductive toxicity as a result of \\nlimitations in the available human data (49). In contrast to the small number of animal \\nstudies with SPI suggesting estrogenicity, lifetime feeding studies in rats fed with soy \\nprotein isolate (SPI), the sole protein source in soy formulas revealed no effects on sex organ \\nweights, no effects on serum sex steroids concentrations and no effects on fertility (36). \\nMoreover, chronic feeding studies with SPI in adult male cynomolgus macaque monkeys \\nalso are reported to have had no effect on testis weight, morphology, serum testosterone or \\nestradiol concentrations, or sperm counts (50). In addition, our laboratory has conducted a \\nseries of studies in ovariectomized adult female rats, in prepubertal male and female rats and \\nin neonatal piglets in which we have utilized genomics analysis either with Affymetrix chips \\nor using RNAseq to examine head to head gene expression profiles in the liver, bone, \\nmammary gland, uterus and testis after treatment with 17β-estradiol (E2) or feeding SPI \\n(51–56). These studies revealed only minor overlap between E2 and SPI-regulated genes (3–\\nRonis et al.\\nPage 5\\nAnnu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol.

Widely consumed nutraceuticals include flavonoid \\nplant pigments such as anthocyanins from berries, flavonols from dark chocolate, \\npolyphenols such as resveratrol from red grapes, and catechins from tea and quercetin. There \\nis little data to suggest that these compounds are toxic. However, metabolites of EGCG – the \\nactive catechol in green tea extract, typically considered to be responsible for green tea’s \\nantioxidant properties – are suspected to enhance oxidative stress and have been associated \\nwith liver injury (58). It is also far from clear that consumption of these nutraceutical \\nsupplements have true health benefits given a lack of large clinical trials (57). The most \\nintensively studied nutraceutical flavonoids are the soy derived isoflavones genistein and \\ndaidzein, and the daidzein metabolite equol. Unlike other flavonoids, the isoflavones in their \\npurified form have been shown to possess estrogenic properties in vitro and in animal \\nmodels, including the ability to produce uterine hypertrophy or reproductive tract \\nmalformations, reduce testis size, inhibit androgen production, reduce fertility, and stimulate \\nestrogen-dependent tumor growth (36,37,45,48,49,51,52,56). Since evidence emerged \\ndemonstrating health risks following hormone replacement therapy in post-menopausal \\nwomen, menopausal women have increasingly turned to use of dietary supplements to treat \\nsymptoms such as hot flashes, depression and bone loss. A recent survey indicated that as \\nmany as 42% of such women were using soy products including isoflavone extracts and \\npurified isoflavones such as genistein (58). Since these are concentrated or purified products, \\nthey can achieve far higher plasma levels than when isoflavones are consumed as part of SPI \\nor soy foods, which are complex mixtures of bioactive proteins, peptides and over one \\nhundred phytochemicals (34,36,51). There have been case reports of endometriosis in \\nwomen consuming isoflavone supplements (59) and, given the clear evidence of \\nestrogenicity, there is a likelihood of increased risk of estrogen sensitive cancers in \\nconsumers of these products.\\nWEIGHT-LOSS, SPORTS, AND BODYBUILDING SUPPLEMENTS\\nAs more and more of the world population becomes overweight and obese, there is a huge \\nmarket for weight-loss products, including dietary supplements. Among military service \\nmembers, athletes and bodybuilders it is also common to ingest dietary sports supplements \\nintended to burn fat and increase performance, muscle mass or strength. As examples, 53% \\nof active-duty US Army soldiers report using at least one dietary supplement per week (60), \\nand 64% of college students participating in athletics use dietary supplements to enhance \\nperformance (61). The supplements are often proprietary blends of several supposedly \\nnatural ingredients. They are not without risk of adverse effects.

Furthermore, bodybuilding and weight loss \\nsupplements account for almost half of these injuries (62). Among emergency department \\nvisits for adverse events related to dietary supplements in the US, around 25% were due to \\nweight loss products (63). There are two classes of adverse effects that may occur. \\nSupplements can have components according to the product description that cause certain \\nside effects. Supplements may also be intentionally spiked with unlisted or illegal \\ncompounds, or drugs such as anabolic steroids. These are so-called adulterated supplements. \\nSupplements containing declared compounds that have not been adequately tested for safety \\ncan also be declared adulterated by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA). It has \\nbeen argued that adulterated supplements shouldn’t be considered real dietary supplements \\n(64). Yet, such supplements exist and can readily be obtained e.g. over the internet. \\nFurthermore, they may be more likely to give real physiological effects desired by the \\nconsumer due to the pharmacological efficiency of anabolic steroids or other drugs \\nincorporated in the supplements. Medical providers and toxicologists should be therefore be \\naware of symptoms elicited by these compounds.\\nBody weight supplements with some documented weight-loss effects were those containing \\nextracts of the plant Ephedra, also known as Ma Huang. Extracts contain the \\nsympathomimetic alkaloids ephedrine, pseudoephedrine, methylephedrine, and \\nnorephedrine. Some of these alkaloids are currently incorporated in common pharmaceutical \\nmedications. For example, pseudoephedrine is included as a nasal decongestant in several \\nbrands of cold and allergy medication in the US like Claritin-D and Sudafed. A \\ncomprehensive meta-analysis of clinical trials showed that ephedra or ephedrine-containing \\nproducts overall led to modest short-term weight loss of approximately 0.9 kg/month better \\nthan placebo (65). There were significant 2.2–3.6 fold increased risks of adverse effects in \\nthe form of psychiatric symptoms, autonomic hyperactivity, heart palpitations, and upper \\ngastrointestinal symptoms (65). Autonomic hyperactivity including symptoms such as \\ntremors, jitteriness, insomnia and increased perspiration was very common, affecting more \\nthan 20% of subjects taking ephedrine. However, caffeine may have contributed to some of \\nthe side effects, as caffeine was included in most of the ephedrine-containing products. A \\nreview of 140 adverse events reports submitted to the FDA between June 1, 1997 and March \\n31, 1999 resulted in 31% of cases considered to the definitely or probably related to the \\nintake of dietary supplements with ephedra alkaloids (66). The most common event was \\nhypertension, but they also included cases of arrhythmia, myocardial infarction, stroke, and \\ncardiac arrest with 3 deaths and 7 permanent disabilities. It led the authors to conclude that, \\n“dietary supplements that contain ephedra alkaloids pose a serious health risks to some \\nusers”. More than a dozen cases of liver injury have also been reported after intake of \\nephedra preparations (67). Dietary supplements with ephedra were banned by the FDA in \\n2004 (68).\\nOne of the compounds that has until recently been widely incorporated in sports \\nsupplements is 1,3-dimethylamylamine (DMAA). It was used in roughly 200 supplements \\nwith more than $100 million in sales in 2010 (69). DMAA is a pharmaceutical developed \\nand patented by Eli Lilly & Co. as a nasal inhaler for rhinitis with “the desirable properties \\nof both ephedrine and amphetamine” (70). It has sympathomimetic and vasoconstrictive \\nproperties. Producers of dietary supplements have listed the compound as a natural \\nRonis et al.\\nPage 7\\nAnnu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol.

However, the presence of \\nDMAA in plants has not been verified, leading to the conclusion that DMAA in supplements \\nis generated by chemical synthesis (72). DMAA has further been banned as a performance \\nenhancing drug by the World Anti-Doping Agency (73). One version of the weight-loss \\nsupplement OxyELITE Pro from USPlabs, LLC contained the compound 1,3-\\ndimethylamylamine (DMAA) in addition to ingredients such as caffeine, Bauhinia purpurea, \\nBacopa monniera, Cirsium oligophyllum, and rauwolscine (Yohimbe) extract. Studies that \\nwere supported financially by USPlabs, LLC with a small number of healthy volunteers \\nsuggested that this supplement formulation could increase lipolysis, metabolic rate, heart \\nrate and systolic blood pressure in the short term (2 h) as well as lead to small decreases in \\nappetite, body weight, and BMI after intake for 8 weeks (74). Accidental intake of \\nsupplements with DMAA, mainly in children, have caused relatively mild adverse effects \\nsuch as tachycardia, nausea, and vomiting (75). However, serious cardiovascular events after \\nDMAA intake have also been reported. Recreational use of DMAA in New Zealand has \\nbeen associated with cases of cerebral hemorrhage (76,77). Furthermore, there are three \\ncases of cardiac arrest occurring during physical exercise in the military and in a gym \\nfollowing intake of DMAA-containing supplements (71,78). Two of the events eventually \\nled to the deaths of US soldiers. While it cannot be proven that DMAA is the causative agent \\nfor all the adverse events, it is clear that DMAA does indeed have cardiovascular effects \\nsuch as vasoconstriction and elevation of blood pressure (79,80). Following receipt of 42 \\nadverse events reports on products with DMAA, the FDA in April 2012 sent warning letters \\nto 10 manufacturers of DMAA-containing supplements stating that since the safety of \\nDMAA had not been documented, the products were adulterated, according to US law (81).\\nIn 2013, a series of severe hepatic liver disease was observed in individuals from Hawaii \\nawaiitaking the weight-loss supplement OxyELITE Pro from USPlabs, LLC (82,83). Eight \\npreviously healthy individuals presented with symptoms such as fatigue, nausea, abdominal \\npain and jaundice. Levels of alanine transaminase and total bilirubin were elevated. Of three \\npatients developing fulminant hepatic failure, two required a liver transplant and one died. A \\nsubsequent outbreak investigation conducted by the Hawaii Department of Health in \\ncollaboration with the CDC and FDA identified a total of 36 cases of acute hepatitis in \\nindividuals exposed to OxyELITE Pro (84). All had dark urine and most had jaundice, loss \\nof appetite and fatigue. Around 2013, additional cases of acute liver injury in patients that \\nhad taken OxyELITE Pro were observed in the US in the Drug-Induced Liver Injury \\nNetwork (DILIN) prospective study and among military personnel in Southern California \\n(85,86). From January 2011 to February 2014, the FDA received adverse event reports for \\n114 consumers that had used OxyELITE Pro. 55 cases (48%) were classified as having liver \\ndisease likely due to OxyELITE Pro (87). The incidence of liver disease seemed to spike \\nafter February 2013. Tallying cases of acute hepatitis of unknown etiology occurring from \\nApril 1, 2013 to December 5, 2013 in individuals who consumed OxyELITE Pro in the 60 \\ndays prior to illness resulted in 69 case patients, of whom 32 were hospitalized, 3 received \\nliver transplants and one died (88). The spike in liver disease coincided with a reformulation \\nof OxyELITE Pro to DMAA-free versions of OxyELITE Pro (“New Formula” and “Super \\nThermo”) that, instead of DMAA, contained the compound aegeline (83).

However, there do not appear to be \\nrelevant studies on the effects of aegeline in humans. In a warning letter to USPlabs, the \\nFDA wrote that aegeline should be classified as a “new dietary ingredient” since it was not \\nmarketed in the US before October 15, 1994. As the company further had failed “to provide \\nreasonable assurance that such ingredient does not present a significant or unreasonable risk \\nof illness or injury”, the FDA deemed the aegeline-containing supplements to be adulterated \\n(90). The aegeline-containing supplements were subsequently recalled (91).\\nIt is unclear if the aegeline in OxyELITE Pro was the hepatotoxic agent causing the outbreak \\nof liver disease. While feeding rats Aegle marmelos plant material has resulted in liver \\nlesions in the form of centrilobular congestion and hydropic degeneration (92), it is \\nunknown whether this was due to aegeline or other compounds. The aegeline in OxyELITE \\nPro may further have been a synthetic compound of unknown purity (93). As no other \\nknown hepatotoxic agents was found in OxyELITE Pro, the specific causative agent remains \\nunidentified (88). The link between the observed cases of hepatitis and OxyELITE intake \\nhas also been questioned. Teschke and Eickhoff argue that clinicians describing the first \\ncases were not sufficiently fastidious in excluding other causes of liver disease such as \\nacetaminophen toxicity, liver cirrhosis, and viral hepatitis, and that causality scores on the \\nRoussel Uclaf Causality Assessment Method (RUCAM) were inflated to show that \\nOxyELITE Pro was the probable cause for the cases (94).\\nIt is remarkable that OxyELITE Pro products have been adulterated with two different \\ncompounds, DMAA and aegeline. There is even a recent notification from the FDA that a \\nbatch of OxyELITE Pro Super Thermogenic was found to contain fluoxetine, also known as \\nProzac (95). While USPlabs, LLC has claimed that this latter batch represented a counterfeit \\nproduct not manufactured by the company, it certainly underscores that segments of the \\ndietary supplement business employ shady or even criminal manufacturing and business \\npractices that result in consumers being exposed to untested or undeclared compounds.\\nOxyELITE Pro is not the only multi-ingredient dietary supplement associated with liver \\ninjury. The LiverTox database lists incidences of hepatotoxicity attributed to the brands \\nSlimquick, Herbalife, Hydroxycut and Move Free (67). Earlier versions of Hydroxycut \\ncontained ephedra, but otherwise the exact mechanisms of injury are generally unknown, \\neven though some of the cases may be due to the content of green tea, Aloe vera, and \\nChinese skullcap.\\nThe examples listed above represent adverse effects caused by ingredients listed by the \\nproducers. More insidious is the addition of unlisted ingredients or drugs to dietary \\nsupplements. Anti-obesity drugs rimonabant, orlistat, and sibutramine or analogues thereof \\nhave been found in weight-loss supplements from Germany, Turkey, China, and Poland (96). \\nSide effects of these drugs, like panic attacks, psychotic episodes, and increases in blood \\npressure and heart rate in the case of sibutramine may therefore also be encountered in \\nindividuals using such adulterated supplements.\\nBody-building supplements are quite often adulterated with anabolic steroids that are \\nmodified variants of androgens designed to increase muscle mass.

Adverse effects of anabolic steroids include cardiomyopathy, \\naltered serum lipids, acne, swollen breast tissues in men and hepatotoxicity (98). Several \\npatients have developed hepatic cholestasis after intake of anabolic androgens (99,100). In \\nthe US, the Drug-Induced Liver Injury Network (DILIN) was established in 2003 to identify \\nand characterize cases of hepatotoxicity caused by dietary supplements and drugs, with the \\nexception of acetaminophen. Among 847 cases whose liver injuries were confirmed to be \\ncaused by drugs or supplements, 45 (5.3%) were due to use of bodybuilding supplements \\n(101). This latter group was characterized by consisting exclusively of males that all had \\njaundice and where most (84%) had pruritus. The pattern of liver injury resembled that of \\nbland cholestasis. Compared to other cases, the levels of serum ALT, AST and ALP were \\nlower, but the levels of total bilirubin were higher, and they were jaundiced for longer \\nperiods of time (101). The mechanism whereby the anabolic steroids induce hepatotoxicity \\nis poorly understood, but it has been hypothesized to be mediated by activation of the \\nandrogen receptor in hepatic cells, leading to upregulation of the rate-limiting enzyme, \\nCPT1, in mitochondrial fatty acid β-oxidation, increased oxidative stress, and ultimately \\nmitochondrial degeneration and hepatotoxicity (98).\\nBOTANICAL SUPPLEMENTS\\nTraditional herbal medicine can be said to be the precursor for both drugs used in modern \\nmedicine that are based on plant compounds (such as aspirin and morphine) and for \\ncontemporary botanical dietary supplements. Herbal and botanical products have sustained \\npopularity given the fact that these natural (i.e. derived from plant root, leaves, or bark) \\nsubstances were among the oldest therapeutics. Estimates published by the CDC as part of \\nthe National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey 2003–2006 reported that 20% of \\nadults use a supplement containing at least one botanical ingredient (102). A common \\nmotivation for taking these substances is to “improve overall health” (3). Accordingly, the \\nUS Food and Drug Administration regulates the majority of botanicals as dietary \\nsupplements and not as drugs developed for the treatment or prevention of specific maladies \\n(103). Botanical use is correlated with non-smoking and higher self-reported health (3). \\nAlarmingly, patients frequently do not report herbal supplement use to primary care \\nphysicians (104), a concern because many botanical supplements may interact with \\nprescribed medications. On their own, bioactive constituents of botanicals can have acute \\nadverse effects that require hospitalization. This review describes acute adverse effects and \\nherb-drug interactions of the most common botanical and herbal supplements.\\nBecause of their plant-based derivation, botanical supplements consist of a mixture of \\norganic compounds. Only a fraction of these compounds is biologically active, with a small \\nsubset of the active compounds having therapeutic and/or toxic mechanisms of action.

As such, reports of \\nadverse effects directly attributable to botanicals are generally rare (105). In most such \\ncases, effects are mild (e.g. nausea, fatigue, and headache). However, more serious clinical \\ncases have appeared, most often relating to adverse effects falling under the general category \\nof drug induced liver injury (DILI) and its associated mechanisms, namely mitochondrial \\ndysfunction, oxidative stress, and alteration of bile acid homeostasis.\\nBlack cohosh (Cimicifuga racemosa) has been associated with jaundice and liver failure in \\nmenopausal women (106). Immunohistochemistry of biopsy samples revealed pathological \\noxidative stress. These results are consistent with in vivo data showing increases in \\nmitochondrial reactive oxygen species and decreased catalase activity with C. racemosa \\ntreatment in a rat menopausal model (107). Similarly, numerous case reports of kava kava \\ndetail liver toxicity sometimes requiring transplants (reviewed in (108)). Candidate \\nmechanisms for kava kava liver toxicity include depletion of glutathione (increasing \\noxidative stress) and inhibition of cyclooxygenases (mitochondrial dysfunction) (109). Saw \\npalmetto use has been associated with cholestatic hepatitis; subsequent alterations in bile \\nsecretion have been linked to pancreatitis (110). Cholestatic symptoms were also seen in \\npatients with acute liver failure that had ingested Echinacea, although a specific mechanism \\nhas not been hypothesized (111). Valerian use induced jaundice that was reversed by steroid \\nadministration in a 57 year-old man (112). Case reports have presented a variety of other \\nnon-hepatic symptoms following botanical use. A bodybuilder taking yohimbe prior to a \\nworkout session suffered a seizure with tachycardia and hypertension, consistent with \\nyohimbine’s sympathomimetic properties (113). A 68 year-old woman taking milk thistle \\npresented with symptoms of exacerbated hemochromatosis (iron overload) that dissipated \\nwhen she stopped taking the supplement. However, this patient was genetically predisposed \\nto hemochromatosis and physicians withdrew excess iron via phlebotomy concomitant with \\nher cessation of milk thistle use (114). Ginseng use was implicated in a transient ischemia \\nattack in a 64 year-old man, though there was no evaluation as to the mechanism (115). In \\nother cardiovascular outcomes, Black cohosh was deemed “probably responsible” for \\nobserved bradycardia in a 59 year-old woman. Slow heart rate is a reported side effect of \\nblack cohosh (116). The wide variety of compounds identified in black cohosh make it \\ndifficult to elucidate mechanisms, although the authors of the above case study speculated \\nthat black cohosh regulates heart rate via activation of serotonin receptors, consistent with \\nexperimental results (117). Both garlic and ginkgo biloba use have been involved in several \\ncases of excessive bleeding. For example, a 71 year-old man had persistent surgical bleeding \\nthat was attributed to indulgent garlic ingestion prior to the operation (118). Furthermore, \\naged garlic extract inhibits platelet aggregation (119). Gingkolide B, an active component of \\ngingko biloba, has been shown to inhibit platelet aggregating factor, and men and women \\ntaking ginkgo biloba have suffered spontaneous bleeding (120).\\nCompared to the above outcomes, more is known about potential herb-drug interactions. \\nPharmacologically active compounds in botanicals are, like drugs, substrates of \\nmetabolizing enzymes. As such, induction or suppression of relevant metabolizing enzymes \\ncan affect the pharmacokinetics of drugs and may warrant contraindications by health care \\nproviders. In vitro studies have implicated activation of the pregnane-X receptor (PXR) and \\nthe aryl hydrocarbon receptor (AhR) as a common mechanisms among several botanicals in \\nRonis et al.\\nPage 11\\nAnnu Rev Pharmacol Toxicol.

Introduction\\nSupplementary drinks or fitness supplements are commonly used to enhance an\\nindividual’s performance in various sports and health settings, catering to both competitive\\nand non-competitive athletes [1]. One widely known supplement for athletes and fitness\\nenthusiasts is protein supplements like protein shakes. Others may be whey protein,\\ncaffeine, and creatine, to name a few. These supplements play a crucial role in helping\\nindividuals increase muscle mass, recover faster, and enhance their overall performance [2].\\nWhey protein stands out as a top-quality protein source, containing more essential amino\\nacids than traditional protein sources.

Meanwhile dietary supplements are presented as\\na compelling alternative to traditional methods for combatting obesity. Wróbel-Harmas\\net al. [107] demonstrated that weight loss supplements are the most frequently sought di-\\netary supplements on the Internet, followed by preparations for muscle building and sexual\\npotency. In the US, more than 30% of people with overweight and obesity believe supple-\\nments to be an effective method for losing weight [108], while in Poland these supplements\\nare used by as many as 40–50% of young women, regardless of their weight [15].'),\n",

The\\nmore complex the recipe, the harder it is to determine its effects on the body.
